Getting Started – Developer Tutorial
This tutorial will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project. In ten to twenty minutes, you will have created your own site and be able to create, preview, and publish your own content, styling, and add new blocks.
Prerequisites:
You have a GitHub account, and understand Git basics.
You have a Google account.
You understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You have Node/npm installed for local development.
This tutorial uses macOS, Chrome, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment and the screenshots and instructions reflect that setup. You can use a different operating system, browser, and code editor, but the UI you see and steps you must take may vary accordingly.
Get started with the boilerplate repository template
The fastest and easiest way to get started following AEM best practices is to create your repository using the Boilerplate GitHub repository as a template.https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate
Click the Use this template button and select Create a new repository, and select the user org that owns the repository
We recommend that the repository is set to public.
The only remaining step in GitHub is to install the AEM Code Sync GitHub App on your repository by visiting this link: https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/new
In the Repository access settings of the AEM Code Sync App, make sure you select Only select Repositories (not All Repositories). Then select your newly created repository, and click Save.
Note: If you are using Github Enterprise with IP filtering, you can add the following IP to the allow list: 3.227.118.73
Congratulations! You have a new website running on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ In the example above that’s https://main--mysite--aemtutorial.aem.page/
Link your own content source using Google Drive
In your fork of the Boilerplate GitHub repository, the site points to an existing content source in Google Drive. See this folder for some example content.
This content is read-only, but it can be copied into your Google Drive folder to serve as a starting point.
To author your own content, create a folder in your own Google Drive and share the folder with the Adobe Experience Manager user (helix@adobe.com).
A good way to start authoring your own content is to copy index, nav and footer from the sample content and familiarize yourself with the content structure. nav and footer are not changed frequently in a project and have a special structure. Most of the files in a project look more similar to index.
Open the files and copy/paste the entire content into corresponding files in your own Google Drive. You can also download the files via Download All or download individual files. However, remember to convert the downloaded .docx files back into native Google Docs, when you upload them to your folder in your Google Drive.
Now that you have your content, you need to connect that content to your GitHub repo. You do this by changing the reference in fstab.yaml in your GitHub repo to the folder you just shared.Copy/paste the folder URL from your Google Drive to fstab.yaml.
Be aware that after you make that change, you will see 404 not found errors as your content has not been previewed yet. Please refer to the next section to see how to start authoring and previewing your content. If you copied over index, nav and footer all three of those are separate documents with their own preview and publish cycles, so make sure you preview (and publish) all of them if needed.
Commit your changes and you have hooked up your own content source to your website.
Preview and publish your content
After completing the last step, your new content source is not empty, but no content has been promoted to the preview or live stages, which means your website serves 404s.To preview content, an author has to install the Sidekick Chrome extension. Find the Chrome extension in the Chrome Web Store.
After adding the extension to Chrome, don’t forget to pin it, this will make it easier to find it.
To set up the Chrome extension, go to your previously shared Google Drive folder and click the extension icon in the browser toolbar and select Add this project.
As soon as the extension is installed and your project is added, you are ready to preview and publish your content from your Google Drive.Select all three docs and activate the AEM Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension. A new toolbar will appear. Clicking the preview or publish buttons will trigger the corresponding operation.
Open the index doc and make some changes. Activate the Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension and then click the Preview button which will trigger the preview operation and open a new tab with the preview rendition of the content.
Start developing styling and functionality
To get started with development, it is easiest to install the AEM Command Line Interface (CLI) and clone your repo locally through using the following.
From there change into your project folder and start your local development environment using the following.
This opens http://localhost:3000/ and you are ready to make changes.A good place to start is in the blocks folder which is where most of the styling and code lives for a project. Simply make a change in a .css or .js and you should see the changes in your browser immediately.
Once you are are ready to push your changes, simply use Git to add, commit, and push and your code to your preview (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/) and production (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/) sites.
That’s it, you made it! Congrats, your first site is up and running. If you need help in the tutorial, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us.

What is Adobe Experience Manager?
Create a website,
seriously fast.
Adobe Experience Manager now integrates the tech you already own, know, and love. Your content, your tech, your audience taken to the next level.
Use the technology you already have
No time for slow sites
Faster sites, better business
You don’t have the time for slow sites – and neither do your visitors.
Business OwnersSlow sites are not just a bad experience, they are also bad business. Why spend to acquire traffic only to lose the engagement on the site? Improved performance improves business outcomes like conversions, time on site, and order values.
VisitorsPerformance is the number one factor limiting user experience of sites on the web. Performance outranks all other factors including design and content. Slow sites means users bounce, leave, and never return.
SEOSlow sites mean most of your audience won’t even see your site. With site performance becoming the most important factor for search engine rankings, this means lost traffic that you need to buy back in ads.
DevelopersMany developers are stuck getting their sites to acceptable performance standards, and great performance seems out of reach. Adobe Experience Manager takes a performance-first approach to delivery, making lighthouse score 100 a reality.
Publish Faster
A CMS that gets out of the way gets your content on the way
Business OwnersBy using the tools your authors already know, you don’t just cut down on time for training and onboarding, you also manage your content in one place. When dealing with structured content, Adobe Experience Manager plays nice with Excel and Google Sheets.
AuthorsAEM takes the unstructured content that you already have, in Word or Google Docs, and turns it into active web experiences. You can use the tools you already know, and all it takes to publish is the press of a button.
DesignersThe content-first approach of AEM turns rigid content modeling chores on its head: the CMS adapts to the content authors create, instead of forcing authors to think in components, structure, and rules of a CMS.
Content OperationsBuilt with the needs of real-world mission-critical sites, AEM cracks the nuts of managing metadata at scale, delivering internationalized and localized content, optimizing for search engines, social sharing, testing, and experimentation.
Develop Faster
Everything modern web development needs, and not a single bit more
Business OwnersWith its lightweight approach to web development, Adobe Experience Manager allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days, and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
OperationsAEM is one less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software as a service and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
DevelopersAEM uses all the things modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, simplicity – and none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead.
Quality EngineersAutomated assurance of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices thanks to built-in quality checks. Continuous assurance of real-world site performance and functionality through real user monitoring.
Benefits
Made to meet your every CMS need and more
Unmatched Speed
The full Adobe Experience Manager stack is optimized for one thing: make your content shine, and make it fast. Delivering at speed is not enough, so we also make it fast to author, publish, and develop.
Content At Scale
From simple sites to ten thousands of pages, AEM handles content at scale, across markets, languages, and countries. And even the biggest sites publish instantly with pushed cache purges.
Uncertainty Eliminated
There’s no place for guesswork in authoring high-performing sites. Each preview generated by AEM offers 100% fidelity, and a unique, easily shareable URL for your reviewers.
Widen the Talent Pool
Using what you already know, is the core of the AEM approach. This means your team can do more with less, requires less training and creates fewer support tickets.
Low Code Productivity
Building great sites does not require complicated frameworks, tooling, or processes. AEM uses plain HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create exceptional experiences without the usual overhead.
Composability is Here
Headless or headful, your content can go farther with AEM’s composable architecture. Deliver the right content in the right format, and add the right decorations to make it an experience that stands out in any channel.
Content First
No matter if structured or unstructured, AEM puts your content first, delivers it optimally and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.
Peak Performance
Every great experience starts and ends with performance. Adobe continuously monitors the performance of your AEM site and lets you know when there are ways to improve. All you have to do is approve the pull request.

https://www.aem.live/docs/sidekick

Using the AEM Sidekick
​​The AEM sidekick provides content authors with a toolbar offering context-aware options so that they can edit, preview, and publish their content directly from the pages of your website.
This document explains how to use the sidekick.
Installation
Please see the document Installing the AEM Sidekick for how to install and configure the sidekick.
Using the Sidekick
The sidekick can be invoked in the following contexts:
Within project environments
Within online editors (depending on your project setup) to edit your content
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
To use the sidekick extension, navigate to a URL associated with your project. This can be one of the following:
A SharePoint or Google document (desktop only)
A Preview URL (the domain name ending in .hlx.page)
A Live URL (the domain name ending in .hlx.live)
A production URL (the domain name being your project’s public host name). Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
The sidekick extension can be toggled by clicking the Adobe Experience Cloud icon next to the address bar.
Adding Projects
Adding projects to your sidekick configuration is optional for most use cases. The sidekick is able to auto-detect if a URL is associated with your project. If you want the sidekick to also recognize custom domains, such as your project’s production domain, you’ll need to persist the project in your sidekick configuration by clicking the + button on the right hand side..
Environment Switcher
The environment switcher on a sidekick in Google Docs.
When using document-based authoring to create content, content moves from the editor through different environments. The environment switcher allows you to easily jump around between them.
Preview
This option takes you to the preview environment, which reflects the latest changes of the page rendered from the source document. You can also send preview URLs to stakeholders so they can review your content before it gets published. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been previewed before.
The preview URL follows the pattern https://branch--repo--org.hlx.page/path.
branch, repo and org identify the location of your project’s underlying code in GitHub
/path corresponds to the location of the content in Google Drive or OneDrive, starting from the root folder.
A / at the end of a path refers to the index document in a folder.
Live
This option is only available if there is not yet a production environment. It shows the published content and serves as a stand-in (and the origin) for your project’s production environment. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been published before.
The live URL looks almost identical to the preview URL, the only difference being in the 1st level domain: https://main--repo--org.hlx.live/path
Production
This option takes you to the production environment, which is your project’s public-facing website. Note that this option may not be available during the development stage of your project or because the content has not been published yet.
This environment can be a 3rd-party or “bring your own” CDN. Depending on the project setup, new content may only appear after a delay.
If your public-facing domain name is yourproject.com, the production URL would be https://yourproject.com/path
Actions
There are a number of actions that you can take on your content by conveniently using the sidekick toolbar. Actions that have not been executed since the content was last changed are badged with an orange indicator.
Preview
\ The preview action on a sidekick in Google Docs.
Preview is the predominant action in the editor. It (re)generates the preview page based on the current document and opens it in a separate tab.
Edit
The Edit action is available in all three environments. It opens the online editor of the current page’s source document in a separate window.
The sidekick in a preview environment.
At a minimum read access to the document in Google Drive or OneDrive is required to use this action.
Reload
The Reload action is available in the preview environment only. It can be used to force a content refresh, for example if you have editor and preview open side by side while working on the content. The action is identical to the Preview action in the editor.
Publish
The Publish action is available in all three environments and makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
The sidekick in a live environment.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Bulk Actions
Open the sidekick in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint and select one or more files to bulk preview and publish files and conveniently copy their URLs. You can also use this feature to preview and publish media like SVG or PDF files.
Adobe continues to extend the support for file formats that can be published directly from your content source (SharePoint or GDrive) based on popular use and security considerations. Currently the supported formats include: PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG.
Formats that are under consideration for being added include: XML, MP4 as well as raw DOCX, XLSX, PPTX without transformation.
Limitation: in Microsoft SharePoint, larger selections (more than 60) may not be fully exposed to the sidekick and may therefore need to be split into smaller badges.
Bulk Preview
Selecting multiple documents in SharePoint or GDrive allows you to preview multiple documents en masse.
Bulk preview in Google Drive.
Bulk Publish
Selecting multiple documents in SharePoint or GDrive allows you to publish multiple documents en masse.
Bulk publish in Google Drive..
Copy URLs
Use this feature to copy the preview, live or production URLs of one or multiple files.
Unpublishing Content
If you need to remove content from your website, the first thing to do is to delete, rename, or move the underlying source document in Google Docs or OneDrive.
For a page without a source document (i.e. it was renamed or moved), the sidekick will show the following two actions when invoked in the preview environment.
Note: If you are signed in to the sidekick, you can skip deleting the underlying source document and simply hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key to bring up the Delete and Unpublish actions.
The sidekick on a preview page without a source document.
Delete
The Delete action will permanently delete the page from all environments, implicitly unpublishing it.
Unpublish
This Unpublish action will unpublish the page, but still keep it in the preview environment for reference.
See the document Authoring and Publishing Content for more information about deleting content.
Caution: The Delete and Unpublish actions cannot be undone! Double-check the URL and page content to make sure it is really OK to delete and/or unpublish a page. The source document may have been moved accidentally and may not need to be deleted.
Sharing the Sidekick
You can share the sidekick configuration for your project by clicking the share symbol at the top right. This will copy a share URL to your clipboard and allow you to paste it in a DM or email to a colleague. The share URL will enable the recipient to effortlessly install the sidekick for your project.
See the document Installing the AEM Sidekick for more information.
Customizing the Sidekick
If you are a developer, you can customize the sidekick for your project.

The Anatomy of a Project
This document describes what a typical project should look like from a code standpoint. Before reading this document, please familiarize yourself with the document Getting Started - Developer Tutorial.
Git and GitHub
One of our defining philosophies is that it is easiest to allow users to work with the tools that they are familiar with. The overwhelming majority of developers manage their code in systems based on Git, so it only makes sense to allow developers to work with Git to manage and deploy their code.
We are using a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repo. After installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repo, websites are automatically created for each of your branches for content preview on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/ and the production site on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.live/ for published content.
Every resource that you put into your GitHub repo is available on your website, so a file in your GitHub repo on the main branch in /scripts/scripts.js will be available on https://main--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/scripts/scripts.jsThis should be very intuitive. There are few “special” files that Adobe Experience Manager uses to connect the content into your website.
We strongly recommend that repos are kept public on GitHub, to foster the community. For a public facing website there really is no need to keep the code hidden, as it is being served to the browsers of your website.
Important notes:
The combination <branch>--<repo>--<owner> must not exceed 63 characters (including the hyphens/dashes). This is a subdomain name constraint.
branch, repo and owner cannot contain --.
Configuration Files
There are some files in your GitHub repo that have a special meaning to AEM and are processed in a special fashion. These files are in the root directory of your repo.
The Content Connection: fstab.yaml
As you may have seen in the getting started guide the fstab.yaml file serves as the connection to your Google Drive or SharePoint folders that contain your content. This file is used as an indicator for how the code in your GitHub repo gets combined with the content in your content source.
Beyond providing the connection to the content, the fstab.yaml also provides a folder mapping facility that allows you map extensionless “routes” to a given piece of content or static HTML.
The Entry Point: head.html
The head.html file is the most important extension point to influence the markup of the content. The easiest way to think of it is that this file is injected on the server side as part of the <head> HTML tag and is combined with the metadata coming from the content.
The head.html should remain largely unchanged from the boilerplate and there are only very few legitimate reasons in a regular project to make changes. Those include remapping your project to a different base URL for the purposes of exposing your project in a different folder than the root folder of your domain on your CDN or to support legacy browsers which usually require scripts that are not loaded as modules.
Adding marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts to your head.html file is strongly advised against due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to head.html is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons, see the section Scripts and Styles below for more information about handling scripts and styles.
Please see the following examples.

To create a custom 404 response, place a 404.html file into the root of your github repository. This will be served on any URL that doesn’t map to an existing resource in either content or code, and replaces the body of the out of the box minimalist 404 response.
The 404 can mimic the markup of an existing page including your code for the site, with navigation footers etc., or it can have a completely different appearance.
Please see the following examples.

Don’t Serve: .hlxignore
There are some files in your repo that should not be served from your website, either because you would like to keep them private or they are not relevant to the delivery of the website (e.g. tests, build tools, build artifacts, etc.) and don’t need to be observed by the AEM bot. You can add those to a .hlxignore file in the same format as the well-known .gitignore file.
Please see the following example.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.hlxignore
Tame the Bots: robots.txt
A robots.txt file is generally a regular file that is served as you would expect on your production website on your own domain. To protect your preview and origin site from being indexed, your .page and .live sites will serve a robots.txt file that disallows all robots instead of the robots.txt file from your repo.
Please see the following examples.

Query and Indexing: helix-query.yaml
There is a flexible indexing facility that lets you keep track of all of your content pages conveniently as a spreadsheet. This facility is often used to show lists or feeds of pages as well as to filter and sort content on a website. Please see the document Indexing for more information.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
Automate Your Sitemap: helix-sitemap.yaml
Complex sitemaps can automatically be created for you whenever authors publish new content, including flexible hreflang mappings where needed. This functionality is usually based on the indexing facility.See this GitHub issue for sitemap configuration options.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/fedpub/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
Commonly Used File and Folder Structure
Beyond the files treats as special or configuration files, there is a commonly-used structure that is expressed in the Boilerplate repo.
The common folders below are usually in the root directory of a project repo, but in cases where only a portion of a website is handled by AEM, they are often moved to a subfolder to reflect the mapping of the route of the origin in a CDN.
This means that in a case where for example only /en/blog/ is initially mapped to AEM from the CDN, all the folder structures below (eg. /scripts, /styles, /blocks etc.) are moved into a the /en/blog/ folder in GitHub to keep the CDN mapping as simple as possible.
With a simple adjustment of the reference to scripts.js and styles.css in head.html (see above) it is possible to indicate that all the necessary files are loaded from the respective code base directory. To avoid url rewriting the folder structure is also created the content source (eg. sharepoint or google drive) by having a directory structure of /en/blog/.In many cases as the AEM footprint grows on a site there is a point in time when the code gets moved back to the root folder and the head.html references are adjusted accordingly.
Scripts and Styles
By convention in a AEM project, the head.html references styles.css, scripts.js, and lib-aem.js located in /scripts and /styles, as the entry points for the project code.
scripts.js is where your global custom javascript code lives and is where the block loading code is triggered. styles.css hosts the global styling information for your site, and minimally contains the global layout information that is needed to display the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).As all three files are loaded before the page can be displayed, it is important that they are kept relatively small and executed efficiently.Beyond styles.css, a lazy-styles.css file is commonly used, which is loaded after the LCP event, and therefore can contain slower/more CSS information. This could be a good place for fonts or global CSS that is below the fold.
In addition to scripts.js, there is the commonly-used delayed.js. This is a catch-all for libraries that need to be loaded on a page but should be kept from interfering with the delivery of the page. This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.
Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.
The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Icons
Most projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection

Block Collection
This is a collection of blocks considered a part of the AEM product and are recommended as blueprints for blocks in your project.
These blocks come from real production AEM projects. To be a part of this collection, a block needs to have a high use across a number of projects and provide enough abstract functionality and be general enough so it can be reused without having to change the underlying content model.
As the needs and designs of websites change, the block collection will change as well. Additions will be made to reflect emerging needs of projects, but blocks that are not used frequently enough will also be removed (deprecated).
There are few technical principles for the blocks in the collection:
Intuitive: Content structure that’s intuitive and easy to author
Useable: No dependencies, compatible with boilerplate
Responsive: Works across all breakpoints
Context Aware: Inherits CSS context such text and background colors
Localizable: No hard-coded content
Fast: No negative performance impact
SEO and A11y: SEO friendly and accessible
All of the blocks can be considered as a basis for your own block development. It is very likely that you will change all the .css and .js code to meet your own project needs. The primary value of these blocks is the content structure they provide.Considering that the code of your block will be fully adapted to your project, there is no intent for the blocks in the collection to be backwards compatible to their respective older versions or to make them upgradable.
Boilerplate
The most commonly used blocks (as well as default content types) are curated in the AEM Boilerplate and are a part of every AEM project. For a block to become a part of boilerplate it has to be used by the vast majority of all AEM projects.
The code base for all the blocks in AEM Boilerplate is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-boilerplate
Blocks in AEM Boilerplate can be discovered using the sidekick library below, use the copy button to copy the corresponding content structure into your clipboard and paste into a document to see the content structure.

Block Collection
The block collection contains blocks that are commonly-used, but are not so common to be considered boilerplate. As a rule-of-thumb, to be included in the block collection a block must be used on more than half of all AEM projects.
The block collection can be the entry path into boilerplate code. Likewise if a block in the boilerplate is no longer used as much, it can be moved to this collection.
The code base for all the blocks in AEM Block Collection is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-block-collection

The block collection is continually evolving based on the feedback from the AEM community. If you think that there is a block that should be included in the block collection please speak to your AEM contact. Current candidates for inclusion in the block collection include:
Consent Banner
If you have immediate need of a block that is not yet part of the collection, it is relatively easy to find AEM projects on GitHub that have example implementations for all of the above candidates.
Block Party
The Block Party is a place for the AEM developer community to showcase what they have built on AEM sites. It also allows others to avoid reinventing the wheel and reuse these blocks / code snippets / integrations built by the community and tweak the code as necessary to fit their own projects. See Block Party for everything it has to offer.
Note: While we love and support our AEM developer community, Adobe is not responsible for maintaining or updating the code that is showcased in Block Party. Please use the code at your own discretion.

https://www.aem.live/developer/spreadsheets

Spreadsheets and JSON
In addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that can easily be consumed by your website or web application.
This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.
Sheets and Sheet structure
The simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data. An example might look something like this.
After a preview and publish via the sidekick, AEM translates this table to a JSON representation which is served to requests to the corresponding .json resource. The above example gets translated to:
AEM allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.
If there is only one sheet, AEM will by default use that sheet as the source of the information.
If there are multiple sheets, AEM will only deliver sheets that are prefixed with helix- which lets you keep additional information and possibly formulas in the same spreadsheet that are not delivered to the web.
If there is a sheet named helix-default, it is delivered if there are no additional query parameters supplied.
See the following section for details on how to query a specific sheet.
Query Parameters
Offset and Limit
Spreadsheets and JSON files can get very large. In such cases, AEM supports the use of limit and offset query parameters to indicate which rows of the spreadsheet are delivered.
As AEM always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore by default AEM limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 if the limit query parameter is not specified. This is sufficient for many simple cases.
Sheet
The sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. As an example ?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named helix-jobs and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for the sheets named helix-jobs and helix-articles.
Special Sheet Names
In certain use cases, AEM also writes to spreadsheets, where it expects specific sheet names.
The forms service only writes to a sheet named incoming, which is never delivered as a JSON.
The index service only writes to a sheet named raw_index, which may be delivered to JSON in a simple single sheet setup.
See the links above for more information on those services.
Arrays
Native arrays are not supported as cell values, so they are delivered as strings.
"tags": "[\"Adobe Life\",\"Responsibility\",\"Diversity & Inclusion\"]"
You can turn them back into arrays in JavaScript using JSON.parse().

https://www.aem.live/developer/indexing

Indexing
Adobe Experience Manager offers a way to keep an index of all the published pages in a particular section of your website. This is commonly used to build lists, feeds, and enable search and filtering use cases for your pages or content fragments.
AEM keeps this index in a spreadsheet and offers access to it using JSON. Please see the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information.
We will introduce the concept of creating a query index by previewing an Excel workbook or Google spreadsheet first. Note, that if you already have a custom query definition in a file called helix-query.yaml in your GitHub repository, it is no longer possible to create indexes that way. Every new index will have to be manually added to that helix-query.yaml.
Setting Up an Initial Query Index
In this section we’ll create a query index in the root folder that will index all documents in your backend.
After setting up your fstab.yaml with a mountpoint that points into your SharePoint site or Google Drive, go to the root folder.
Depending on your backend, create either a workbook named query-index.xlsx for SharePoint or a spreadsheet named query-index for Google Drive.
In that spreadsheet or workbook, create a sheet named raw_index.
Setting Up Properties to be Added to the Index
In your query-index document, add a header line and in the first column add path as the header name.
In the following columns of the header line, add all other properties you need extracted from the rendered HTML page.
In the following example in Google Drive, the extracted fields are title, image, description, and lastModified.
Pages are indexed when they are published. To remove pages from index, they have to be unpublished.
For simple scenarios without custom index definition, pages that have robots metadata property set to noindex will automatically be omitted from indexing by AEM. (There are a few special scenarios here, for more details see the section Special Scenarios for Robots).
The following table summarizes the properties that are available and from where in the HTML page they’re extracted.
Returns the content of the meta tag named article:tag in the head element as an array.
See the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information on array-handling.
For every other header added, the indexer will try to find a meta tag with a corresponding name.
Activate Your Index
To activate your index, preview the spreadsheet using the sidekick. This will create an index configuration.
Checking Your Index
The Admin Service has an API endpoint where you can check the index representation of your page. Given your GitHub owner, repository, branch and owner, and a resource path to a page, its endpoint is:
https://admin.hlx.page/index/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>
You should get a JSON response where the data node contains the index representation of the page.
Debugging Your Index Configuration
The AEM CLI has a feature where it will print the index record whenever you change your query configuration, which assists in finding the correct CSS selectors:
$ aem up --print-index
Please see the AEM CLI GitHub documentation for more information and watch this video to learn more about this feature.
Setting Up More Index Configurations
You can define your own custom index configurations by creating your own helix-query.yaml. This allows you to have more than one index configuration in the same helix-query.yaml, where parts of your sites are indexed into different Excel workbooks or Google spreadsheets. See the document Indexing reference for more information.
Special Scenarios for Robots
There are a few nuances on how pages get indexed by AEM in conjunction with indexing setup for your site. Let’s look at them:
In the following 2 situations, setting robots to noindex on the page metadata would not prevent it from being indexed by AEM:
You have added a robots column in query-index.xlsx
You have a helix-query.yaml in your Github repository i.e. you have defined a custom index definition.
Recommendations
If you do not have a custom index definition, it is recommended to not add a robots column to your index sheet unless you have a requirement for doing so.Adding robots column to your index sheet would cause a page to be indexed by AEM even though it may have robots metadata set to noindex.
If you do have a custom index definition, pages would get indexed by AEM irrespective of setting robots to noindex on the page metadata. If you want to prevent this from happening, you can use spreadsheet filters to omit pages from index that have robots metadata set to noindex. For more details, see the section titled "Enforcing noindex configuration with custom index definitions" below.
Enforcing “noindex” configuration with custom index definitions
If you have defined your own custom index definitions in helix-query.yaml, setting the robots property to noindex is not effective in preventing the pages from getting indexed. In order to enforce noindex configuration is such situations, do the following:
Create a sheet named “helix-default” in your query-index.xlsx . After this, your query-index.xlsx spreadsheet should have 2 sheets “raw_index” and “helix-default”. The “raw_index” sheet is there to have all the raw indexed data.
Modify your custom helix-query.yaml (it must be in your project’s Github repository) and add the robots property so that it gets indexed.
Now set up your “helix-default” sheet in the query-index.xlsx spreadsheet to get automatically filled up using Excel formula which ensures that all the rows in raw_index which have robots property set as noindex, do not get copied over to the helix-default sheet. This can be done by using an Excel formula like this =FILTER(Table1,NOT(Table1[robots]="noindex"))
Now your helix-default sheet has only the rows from raw_index that do not have robots property set to noindex.
Ensure that you publish the pages that you want to get indexed.
Now if you fetch the index as usual like: https://<branch>--<repo>-<org>.hlx.page/query-index.json, you’d only get data from helix-default sheet i.e. entries that are not explicitly prevented from getting indexed through the robot property set as noindex.

Web Performance, Keeping your Lighthouse Score 100.
The quality of the experience of websites is crucial to achieving the business goals of your website and the satisfaction of your visitors.
Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is optimized to deliver excellent experiences and optimal web performance. With the Real Use Monitoring (RUM) operations data collection, information is continuously collected from field use and offers a way to iterate on real use performance measurements without having to wait for the CRuX data to show effects of code and deployment changes. It is common for field data collected in RUM to deviate from the lab results, as the network, geo-location and processing power for real devices are much more diverse than the simulated conditions in a lab.
The Google PageSpeed Insight Service is proven to be a great lab measurement tool. It can be used to avoid the slow deterioration of the performance and experience score of your website.
If you start your project with the Boilerplate as in the Developer Tutorial, you will get a very stable Lighthouse score on PageSpeed Insight for both Mobile and Desktop at 100. On every component of the lighthouse score there is some buffer for the project code to consume and still be within the boundaries of a perfect 100 lighthouse score.
Testing Your Pull Requests
It turns out that it is hard to improve your Lighthouse score once it is low, but it is not hard to keep it at 100 if you continuously test.
When you open a pull request (PR) on a project, the test URLs in the description of your project are used to run the PageSpeed Insights Service against. The AEM GitHub bot will automatically fail your PR if the score is below 100 with a little bit of buffer to account for some volatility of the results.
The results are for the mobile lighthouse score, as they tend to be harder to achieve than desktop.
Why Google PageSpeed Insights?
Many teams and individuals use their own configurations for measuring Lighthouse scores. Different teams have developed their own test harnesses and use their own test tools with configurations that have been set up as part of their continuous monitoring and performance reporting practices.
The performance of a website impacts its rankings in search results, which is reflected by the Core Web Vitals in the crUX report. Google has a great handle on the relevant average combinations of device information (e.g. screen size) as well as network performance of those devices. But in the end, SEO is the ultimate arbiter of what good vs. bad web performance is. As the specific configuration is a moving target, performance practices should be aligned with the current average devices and network characteristics globally.
So instead of using a project specific configuration for Lighthouse testing, we use the continuously-updated configurations seen as part of the mobile and desktop strategies referenced in the latest versions of the Google PageSpeed Insights API.
While there may be additional insight that some developers feel they can collect from other ways of measuring Lighthouse scores, to be able to have a meaningful and comparable performance conversation across projects, there needs to be a way to measure performance universally. The default PageSpeed Insight Service is the most authoritative, most widely accepted lab test when it comes to measuring your performance.However it is important to remember that the recommendations that you get from PageSpeed Insights do not necessarily lead to better results, especially the closer you get to a lighthouse score of 100.Core Web Vitals (CWV) collected by the built-in RUM data collection play an important role in validating results. For minor changes, however, the variance of the results and the lack of sufficient data points (traffic) over a short period of time makes it impractical to get statistically relevant results in most cases.
Three-Phase Loading (E-L-D)
Dissecting the payload that's on a web page into three phases makes it relatively straight-forward to achieve a clean lighthouse score and therefore set a baseline for a great customer experience.
The three phase loading approach divides the payload and execution of the page into three phases
Phase E (Eager): This contains everything that's needed to get to the largest contentful paint (LCP).
Phase L (Lazy): This contains everything that is controlled by the project and largely served from the same origin.
Phase D (Delayed): This contains everything else such as third-party tags or assets that are not material to experience.
Phase E: Eager
In the eager phase, everything that's needed to be loaded for the true LCP to be displayed is loaded. In a project, this usually consists of the markup, the CSS styles and JavaScript files.
In many cases the LCP element is contained in a block (often created by auto blocking), where the block .js and and .css also have to be loaded.
The block loader unhides sections progressively, which means that all the blocks of the first section have to be loaded for the LCP to become visible. For this reason, it might make sense to have a smaller section containing as little as needed at the top of a page.
It is a good rule of thumb to keep the aggregate payload before the LCP is displayed below 100kb, which usually results in an LCP event quicker than 1560ms (LCP scoring at 100 in PSI). Especially on mobile the network tends to be bandwidth constrained, so changing the loading sequence before LCP has minimal to no impact.
Loading from or connecting to a second origin before the LCP occurred is strongly discouraged as establishing a second connection (TLS, DNS, etc.) adds a significant delay to the LCP.
Phase L: Lazy
In the lazy phase, the portion of the payload is loaded that doesn't affect total blocking time (TBT) and ultimately first input delay (FID).
This includes things like loading blocks (JavaScript and CSS) as well as loading all the remaining images according to their loading="lazy" attribute and other JavaScript libraries that are not blocking. The lazy phase is generally everything that happens in the various blocks you are going to create to cover the project needs.
In this phase it would still be advisable that the bulk of the payload come from the same origin and is controlled by the first party, so that changes can be made if needed to avoid negative impact on TBT, TTI and FID.
Phase D: Delayed
In the delayed phase, the parts of the payload are loaded that don't have an immediate impact to the experience and/or are not controlled by the project and come from third parties. Think of marketing tooling, consent management, extended analytics, chat/interaction modules etc. which are often deployed through tag management solutions.
It is important to understand that for the impact on the overall customer experience to be minimized, the start of this phase needs to be significantly delayed. The delayed phase should be at least three seconds after the LCP event to leave enough time for the rest of the experience to get settled.
The delayed phase is usually handled in delayed.js which serves as an initial catch-all for scripts that cause TBT. Ideally, the TBT problems are removed from the scripts in question either by loading them outside of the main thread (in a web worker) or by just removing the actual blocking time from the code. Once the problems are fixed, those libraries can easily be added to the lazy phase and be loaded earlier.
Ideally there is no blocking time in your scripts, which is sometimes hard to achieve as commonly used technology like tag managers or build tooling create large JavaScript files that are blocking as the browser is parsing them. From a performance perspective it is advisable to remove those techniques, make sure your individual scripts are not blocking and load them individually as separate smaller files.
Header and Footer
The header and specifically the footer of the page are not in the critical path to the LCP, which is why they are loaded asynchronously in their respective blocks. Generally, resources that do not share the same life cycle (meaning that they are updated with authoring changes at different times) should be kept in separate documents to make the caching chain between the origins and the browser simpler and more effective. Keeping those resources separate increases cache hit ratios and reduces cache invalidation and cache management complexity.
Fonts
Since web fonts are often a strain on bandwidth and loaded from a different origin via a font service like https://fonts.adobe.com or https://fonts.google.com, it is largely impossible to load fonts before the LCP, which is why they are usually added to the lazy-styles.css and are loaded after the LCP is displayed.
LCP Blocks
There are situations where the actual LCP element is not included in the markup that is transmitted to the client. This happens when there is an indirection or lookup (for example a service that’s called, a fragment that’s loaded or a lookup that needs to happen in a .json) for the LCP element.In those situations, it is important that the page loading waits with guessing the LCP candidate (currently the first image on the page) until the first block has made the necessary changes to the DOM.To identify which blocks to wait for before blocking for the LCP load, you can add the blocks that contain the LCP element to the LCP_BLOCKS array in scripts.js.
Bonus: Speed is Green
Building websites that are fast, small, and quick to render is not just a good idea to deliver exceptional experiences that convert better, it is also a good way to reduce carbon emissions.

Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking
To design websites and create functionality, developers use the markup and DOM that is rendered dynamically from the content. The markup and DOM are constructed in a way that allows flexible manipulation and styling. At the same time it provides out-of-the-box functionality so the developer does not have to worry about some of the aspects of modern websites.
Structure of a Document
The single most important aspect when structuring a document is to make it simple and intuitive for authors who will contribute the content.
This means that it is strongly recommended to involve authors very early in the process. In many cases it is good practice to just let authors put the content that needs to go on to a page into a Google Doc or Word document without having any notion of blocks and section, and then try to make small structural changes and introduce sections and blocks only where necessary.
A document follows the following structure in the abstract.
A page as authored in Word or a Google Doc document uses the well-understood semantic model like headings, body text, lists, images, links, etc. that is shared between HTML, markdown, and Google Doc / Word. We call this default content. In an ideal situation one would leave as much of the content authored as default content as possible, since this is the natural way for authors to treat documents.In addition to default content, we have a concept of page sections, separated by horizontal rules or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together. A simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.In addition to that there is concept of blocks which are authored as a table with a heading as the first row that identifies the type of block. This concept is the easiest approach to componentize your code.
Sections can contain multiple blocks. Blocks should never be nested as it makes things very hard to use for authors.
DOM vs. Markup
AEM produces a clean and easily readable semantic markup from the content that’s provided to it. You can easily access it using the view source feature and have a look at the markup of the page you are currently reading.
The JavaScript library used in scripts.js takes the markup and enhances it into a DOM that is then used for most development tasks, specifically to build blocks. To create a DOM that’s easy to work with for custom project code, it is best to view it as a two-step process.
In the first step, we create the markup with sections, blocks, and default content that will look similar to this.
In the second step, the above mark-up is augmented into the following example DOM, which then can be used for styling and adding functionality. The differences between the markup that’s delivered from the server and the augmented DOM that is used for most of the development tasks is highlighted below.
It primarily consists of introducing a wrapper <div> for blocks and default content and dynamically adding additional helpful CSS classes and data attributes that are used by the AEM block loader.
Sections
Sections are a way to group default content and blocks by the author. Most of the time section breaks are introduced based on visual differences between sections such as a different background color for a part of a page.
From a development perspective, there is usually not much interaction with sections beyond CSS styling.Sections can contain a special block called Section Metadata, which results in data attributes to a section. The names of the data attributes can be chosen by the authors, and the only well-known section metadata property is Style which will be turned into additional CSS classes added to the containing section element.
Blocks and default content are always wrapped in a section, even if the author doesn’t specifically introduce section breaks.
Default Content
There is a broad range of semantics that are shared between Word documents, Google Docs, markdown, and HTML. For example there are headings of different levels (eg. <h1> - <h6>), images, links, lists (<ul>, <ol>), emphasis (<em>, <strong>) etc.
We take advantage of the intuitive understanding that authors have of how to use these semantics in the tools that they are familiar with (eg. Word/Google docs) and maps those to markdown and then renders them in the HTML markup.
All mappings should be relatively straightforward and intuitive for the developer. One area where we go a little bit further than the simplest possible translation is in handling images. Instead of a simple <img> tag, a full <picture> tag is rendered with a number of different resolutions needed for display on desktop and mobile devices as well as different formats for modern browsers that support webp and older browsers which do not.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents and developers write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the CSS and JavaScript files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page. The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling.
The JavaScript is loaded as a Module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
All block level CSS should be scoped to the block to make sure that there are no side-effects for other parts of your project, which means that all selectors in a block should be prefixed with the corresponding block class. In certain cases it makes sense to use the block’s wrapper or containing section for the selector as well.
There is a balance of DOM manipulation in JavaScript and complexity of the CSS selectors. Complex brittle CSS selectors are not recommended and at the same time adding classes to every element makes your code more complex and disregards the semantics of elements.
One of the most important tenets of a project is to keep things simple and intuitive for authors. Complicated blocks make it hard to author content, so it is important that developers absorb the complexity of translating an intuitive authoring experience into the DOM that is needed for layout or application logic. It is often tempting to delegate complexity to the author. Instead, developers should make sure that blocks do not become unwieldy to create for authors. An author should always be able to simply copy/paste a block and intuitively understand what it is about.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Blocks can be very simple or contain full application components or widgets and provide a way for the developer to componentize their codebase into small chunks of code that can be managed easily and can be loaded on to the web pages as needed.
A block’s content is rendered into the markup as nested <div> tags for the rows and columns that the author entered. In the simplest case, a block has only a single cell.
Authors can add blocks to their pages in an ad-hoc manner by simply adding a table with the block name in the first row or table heading. Some blocks are also loaded automatically. header and footer blocks that need to be present on every page of a site are a good example of that.
Block Options
If you need a block to look or behave slightly differently based on certain circumstances, but not different enough to become a new block in itself, you can let authors add block options to blocks in parentheses. These options add modified classes to the block. For example Columns (wide) in a table header will generate the following markup.
<div class=”columns wide”>
Block options can also contain multiple words. For example Columns (super wide) will be concatenated using hyphens.
<div class=”columns super-wide”>
If block options are comma-separated, such as Columns (dark, wide), they will be added as separate classes.
<div class=”columns dark wide”>
Auto Blocking
In an ideal scenario the majority of content is authored outside of blocks, as introducing tables into a document makes it harder to read and edit. Conversely blocks provide a great mechanism for developers to keep their code organized.
A frequently-used mechanism to get the best of both worlds is called auto blocking. Auto blocking turns default content and metadata into blocks without the author having to physically create them. Auto blocking happens very early in the page decoration process before blocks are loaded and is a practice that programmatically creates the DOM structure of a block as it would come as markup from the server.
Auto blocking is often used in combination with metadata, particularly the template property. If pages have a common template, meaning that they share a certain page design or functionality, that’s usually a good opportunity for auto blocking.
A good example is an article header of a blog post. It might contain information about the author, the title of the blog post, a hero image, as well as the publication date. Instead of having the author put together a block that contains all that information, an auto block (e.g. article-header block) would be programmatically added to the page based on the <h1>, the first image, the blog author, and publication date metadata.
This allows the content author to keep the information in its natural place, the document structure outside of a block. At the same time, the developer can keep all the layout and styling information in a block.
Another very common use case is to wrap blocks around links in a document. A good example is an author linking to a YouTube video by simply including a link, while the developer would like to keep all the code for the video inline embed in an embed block.
This mechanism can also be used as a flexible way to include both external applications and internal references to video, content fragments, modals, forms, and other application elements.
The code for your projects auto blocking lives in buildAutoBlocks() in your scripts.js.
Please see the following examples of auto blocking.

Favicon
Adding a favicon to your site gives it a professional look in your visitor’s browsers:
Adding a favicon
Add a file called favicon.ico to the root folder in your GitHub repository. We recommend using the .ico format for best support across all major browsers. That’s all – your site now has a favicon!

Custom HTTP Response Headers
In some cases, it is useful to apply custom HTTP response headers to resources, for example to allow CORS. If you want to specify headers, create either an Excel Workbook or a Google Sheets Workbook in the /.helix folder of your website in Sharepoint or Google Drive called headers.xlsx in SharePoint or headers in Google Drive.
The workbook should have only one sheet and can define response headers using the url/key/value format as shown below.
The URL column is a glob pattern matching the pages that should have the header should be applied to. A wildcard * can be used as a prefix or suffix, allowing for flexible matches on the URL pathname. Typical examples include /docs/** or **/docs/**.
After you update the sheet, you need to preview it. Note that the headers are applied to the preview and live versions of the page. You might need to purge the live or production cache for the change to take effect. See the Admin API documentation for more information.
If the headers apply to resources in codebus (coming from a sync GitHub repository, as opposed to content) then the changes won’t take effect until the codebus is synced again, either by updating the targeted code in GitHub or by manually updating via the Admin API.

Development Collaboration and Good Practices
Working with a large number of development teams across many projects and organizations we found that it is useful to collect some of our insights. Some of those are related to AEM, but the majority are related to general purpose frontend development or are just general guidelines on how to collaborate in a team of developers.
You may read some of those items and think that it is generally understood as common sense amongst developers. We agree, and that’s a great sign that you are ready to work in a collaborative way on AEM projects together with other developers.
At this point this is just a collection of lessons learned from our engagements on a growing set of projects.
GitHub
Create Pull Requests
If you work on a project with multiple developers it is rarely a good idea to push directly to main. When your project is in production code changes that are merged or pushed to main often means that they are released to production. Protecting your main branch is a good mechanism to ensure that people don’t push to main by accident, which is especially advisable with a site that is in production. Keep the scope of your Pull Request to what’s in the title / description of the PR.
Pull Request etiquette
If you open a pull request, make sure that you include a URL to a page (or a number of links to pages) on your branch, where the reviewer can see your code in action. If you are updating code of an existing block, make sure to include the link that features the block you are updating as the reviewer may not know where this block is in use to test its functionality.
AEM Github Bot
The AEM Github Bot and standard Boilerplate project setup will check linting of your CSS/JS and PageSpeed Insights for Web Performance, Accessibility, SEO and Best Practices. Do not submit a Pull Request for Review that has linting errors or doesn’t have a Lighthouse Score from Page Speed Insights of 100.
Reviews
It is good practice to have your code reviewed by the maintainer or main developer of the project you are working on. For the reviewer to see a realistic PageSpeedInsight performance score, include links to the cached .live environment.If you are a maintainer or lead developer on a project that is not in production and you are adding code or are changing your own code, it sometimes is unnecessary overhead to have your PRs reviewed by peers and it is often ok to merge your own PRs without a peer review.
Merging Pull Requests
Merge your own pull requests only. If the person who opened the Pull Request has the ability to merge their own Pull Request, the author of the code is the ideal person to merge. There are situations where the author specifically states that this can and should be merged by someone else, and in those cases a maintainer (main developer) of the project should feel free to merge a Pull Request.Even if a Pull Request is approved, you should always check with the author of the Pull Request if they are ready to merge.For work still in progress, opening A Draft Pull Request also helps prevent accidental merging.
Shared branches
It is good practice to consider branches for individual Pull Requests as initially a private location of the developer that created the branch. Do not just push into other developers’ branches without having been invited to do so. There are situations where people are collaborating on Pull Requests but it should be an explicit agreement.
(Scaled) Trunk-based Development
AEM works great in a scaled trunk-based development with built-in devops and CI/CD. Meaning you merge a large number of small pull requests into main (production) but the Quality Assurance / Review efforts can be tailored to the impact of a small change. Nobody wants to review and test large pull requests, and long-lived branches with lots of changes tend to be difficult (and dangerous) to merge.
Linting
Don’t change the linting configurations (eslint airbnb-base and stylelint) unless you have a really good reason. Personal preference is not a good reason. Changing linting makes it very hard to move developers from project to project. Arguing if something is a good reason to change the linting configuration is usually a lot more effort than just categorically saying no.
CSS
CSS Selector Block Isolation
AEM blocks most often operate as components collaboratively in the same DOM / CSSOM. This means that you should write your CSS selectors in a block .css in a way that isolates your CSS from impacting layout of elements outside your block. The easiest way to do this is by making sure that every CSS selector in the .css of a block only applies to the block.
Cascade in CSS
Use your CSS classnames wisely. Some CSS classes and variables are used across different blocks, and others are not expected to be used outside your block. Prefixing classes and variables that are private to your block with the block name is good practice. Conversely if there are CSS classes and CSS context that should be inherited (often those can be authored) those classes and variables should not be prefixed.
CSS indentation and property order
Outside of a CSS refactoring PR, don’t change sequencing on properties or the indentation across the CSS files you touch in a functional PR. Every developer has different preferences on sort order of properties or indentation. Make sure the diff that you see in your PR is isolated to the changes you actually want reviewed before submitting it.
CSS Selectors Complexity
Don’t let your CSS Selectors become complex and unreadable. Often it is better to decorate additional CSS classes / Elements onto your DOM and write readable CSS instead. Complex CSS selectors also often are harder to maintain and more brittle than the equivalents in JS.
CSS naming
Naming your classes simple and intuitive is helpful for other developers. Avoid namespacing unless it is necessary within the scope of a project. There is often no need to specify the type or the origin (eg. the name of your design system) of a CSS variable that is to be used across the entire project.
Leverage ARIA Attributes for styling
In many situations you will add ARIA Attributes for accessibility. Since those have well defined semantics like expanded or hidden that are understood by all developers, in most cases there is really no need to come up with additional classes in your vocabulary that have unknown semantics.
Mobile First
Generally Web projects should be developed “Mobile First”. This means that your CSS without media query should render a mobile site. Add media queries to extend the layout for tablet and desktop.
Breakpoints
Generally use 600px, 900px and 1200px as your breakpoints, all min-width. Don’t mix min-width and max-width. Only use different breakpoints in exceptional cases where you have good understanding why that’s needed.
Less, Sass, PostCSS, Tailwind and friends.
If you are working in the context of a bigger organization, make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency to any CSS preprocessor or Framework of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization. As there are a lot of differing personal preferences in this area, it makes code hard to maintain if every project or every block inside a project uses different technologies.The simplest solution is to rely on the growing CSS featureset which is supported by the browsers.
Modern CSS features
Make sure the features you are using are well supported by evergreen browsers. Depending on the features more or less pervasive support may be acceptable.
JavaScript
Frameworks
On most web sites, frameworks are overkill for simple layout problems outside of application-like functionality. Frameworks often introduce web performance issues (Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals), particularly if they are in the pathway of the LCP or introduce TBT, while trying to address trivial problems. Keep simple things simple.If you are using Javascript Frameworks make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency to any JS Framework or library of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization. As there are a lot of personal preferences, it makes code hard to maintain if every project or every block inside a project uses different technologies.The simplest solution is to rely on the growing featureset supported by browsers.
Build tool chain
Differing build tool chains from project to project make it hard for new developers to be onboarded and often introduce additional complexity. Make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization.The simplest solution is to keep the entire project build-less.
Modern JavaScript features
Make sure the features you are using are well supported by evergreen browsers. Depending on the features more or less pervasive support may be acceptable. While AEM can be used with any browser, lib-franklin.js has a dependency on browsers that support dynamic import(). Any feature that is supported by the set of browsers that support dynamic import() should be considered safe. Technically of course older browsers (eg. IE) can be supported by AEM projects, but those require heavy customization.
Not all features have the same consequences if a browser doesn’t support them, some may be cosmetic and others may stop the site from working. A common example is “optional chaining”. If a browser doesn’t support “optional chaining”, a single usage can have fatal consequences for the entire page.
Loading 3rd party libraries
Don’t add 3rd party libraries to your <head> via head.html as they will be in the critical path of loading content above the fold and will often be loaded when they are not needed. Add the dependencies where needed via loadScript() to the specific block that has the corresponding requirement.In case of larger 3rd party libraries, you may even want to consider using an IntersectionObserver to make sure you only load them when the block depending on it is actually being scrolled into view.
AEM Library (aem.js)
The AEM library (usually hosted in aem.js in a project) is currently not minified and obfuscated to make debugging easier. We discourage making changes to it on a project basis and instead recommend project specific extensions to be kept outside of the library. We welcome Pull Requests via github, if you would like to propose changes / bug fixes that are universally applicable.
<head>
The <head> that is delivered from the server as part of the HTML markup should remain minimal and free of marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to <head> is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons.
Content in Sharepoint / Google Drive
Start your development with Content
Before writing a line of code, create your (sample) content in a Word or Google Doc (or spreadsheet). Make sure that it feels good for authoring and share it with people on your team that have experience supporting authors. It requires support experience to understand what content structures are easy for authors to understand and recreate. Once you have settled on a content structure that contains all elements you need for your block, and have it reviewed you can get started developing your CSS and JS code.
Use /drafts
The content lifecycle is very different from the code life cycle. If you are proposing changes to an existing content structure in your code or come up with a new block, don’t just make those changes on the page you are working on. Copy the page into your /drafts/<yourname>/ folder and make changes there.Once your code changes are merged to main , you can have authors copy or merge your content with the content outside of your /drafts/ folder.
Backwards compatibility of new features
Especially in production environments it is important to keep your anticipated changes to the content structure backwards compatible with existing content. Ideally code that is being merged should not have an impact on the website or require refactoring the content. Only when new content is put in place through a preview and publish cycle, the new functionality becomes available. This of course doesn’t apply to things like design changes across the existing content or functional bug fixes.
Use Content for “static” resources
Generally, it is not a good idea to commit binaries into your GitHub repo. Even text-based static resources for example HTML files or SVGs should only be put into GitHub in exceptional cases. A good reason to add an SVG to your git repo is if it is referenced from code. Don’t commit anything that is related to the content authoring process, or could be a part of an authoring process. There are some exceptions (usually related to legacy and non-browser clients) that require a certain set of fixed resources that cannot be produced and manipulated dynamically by AEM, but in general if you find a large set of static resources (eg. images, etc.) or an HTML file in a PR it is most likely not a good practice.
Use Content for Strings / Literals
Strings that are displayed to end-users and could possibly be translated or changed at some point should always be authorable and sourced from content (eg. placeholders, or other spreadsheets or documents). If you have a literal string that is displayed as text to the visitor of your website in your javascript or css code it is good practice to replace it with a reference to content (eg. placeholders).

Authoring and Publishing Content
Authoring Content
You already know the most important part.
If you use Microsoft Word or Google Docs, then you already know how to create content.
Your documents in Word or Google Docs become your pages on your website. Your headings in your documents will become headings on your website. Bold, italic, underlining, lists, images, etc. will all appear on your website.
Images and Videos
To add an image to your document, drag the image into the page. Word and Google Docs automatically add it as normal. Your image will be resized to fit the browser window of your visitor. Any resizing you do in Word or Google Docs will have no effect.
It is a good idea to set an alternative text for all images you add to the document, as this increases accessibility and helps search engines find your content.
To do this, use the built-in features of both Word and Google Docs. See the documentation of either product for more details.
Microsoft Word: Add alternative text to a shape, picture, chart, SmartArt graphic, or other object
Google Docs: Make your document or presentation more accessible
Word and Google Docs do not allow you to just drag and drop videos, but you can add videos via SharePoint or Google Drive and add the resulting URL as a link to a suitable block in your document.
Links
Links are an important part of every website and you can add them both in Word and Google Docs. If you are creating a link within your website, enter the URL as is, even if the page you are linking to is not public yet (e.g. a preview or live URL).
Links pointing to other pages on the same site will automatically be adjusted to be relative to your site.
You can link to headings or sections within a page by appending an anchor value to the URL. Heading elements have automatic lower-cased IDs where spaces are replaced with dashes. For example, if a page /about-us has a heading “Our History”, the URL linking to it would be https://<your_host>/about-us#our-history.
Sections
On some websites you have sections or blades that change background color or otherwise indicate breaks in the content. Creating a section break in both Microsoft Word and Google Docs can be done using --- (three hyphens) on a single line. In Google Docs you can also create sections by inserting a Horizontal Line element into the page (select “Insert → Horizontal Line” from the menu).
Metadata & SEO
Metadata is information about your page that is invisible to visitors, but important to search engines and social media sites that want to find your content or embed it.
To add metadata to your page, at the end of the document, create a table like the following. Creating a table works almost the same in Word and Google Docs. See the documentation of either product for more details.
Microsoft Word: from the menu, click “Insert → Table” and select the number of columns and rows you want
Google Docs: from the menu, click “Insert → Table” and choose how many rows and columns you want to add
Structure your table like this:
The first row of the table should just contain the word “Metadata”. This tells the system that there is custom metadata for your document.
Then create one row for each metadata property. The left column contains the name of the metadata property, the right column the value. In most cases, values are plain text, but as you can see from the “image” row, sometimes other content can be used, too.
You’ve just created a metadata block. You can also create metadata for many pages at once. See the document Bulk Metadata for more information.
Special metadata properties
The metadata block has a few special properties that can serve multiple purposes.
image - this will be shown as og:image, og:image, secure_url, and twitter:imageDefault: If not specified, AEM will use the first image found on the page. If the page does not contain an image, the default value will be /default-meta-image.png (you can add this file via SharePoint or GitHub).
title - will be used as og:title as well twitter:title and <title>Default: If not specified, AEM will use the first heading 1 (h1) found on the page.
canonical - will be used as <link rel=”canonical”>
description - will be used as description, og:description, twitter:descriptionDefault: If not specified, AEM will use the first paragraph (p) found on the page which contains at least 10 words.
json-ld - renders a JSON schema inside a <script type=”application/ld+json”> element. Please consider other methods like JavaScript or head.html to add schema to your page, in many cases metadata is not the right approach.
Omitting metadata values
If you want to omit a metadata, you can leave its value cell empty.
Blocks
Blocks are a way to work with more structured content and add special functionality to your site. Which blocks are available to your site depends on what your development team has implemented and differs from site to site. The only block that is common to all sites is the metadata block described previously.
Regardless of site, the structure of a block is always the same: it is a table with a merged first row that serves as the block name (header row). The header row may have specific formatting like a background color to increase their discoverability and differentiation in a document.
Blocks usually contain content, configuration, or references to other pieces of content, be it from other documents, spreadsheets, or both.
As you can see from this example, you are free to put any kind of content into the cells of a block, and it is up to the block to either render the content or ignore it. If the site you are working on uses blocks extensively, then you will probably have a reference list of blocks you can use.
Blocks can have variants in parenthesis. For example, a Columns block can have a (highlight)option which passes a layout hint to the block display logic.
See the document The Block Collection to learn more about out-of-the-box blocks.
Structured Data in Spreadsheets
You can put content into spreadsheets and then the spreadsheet is automatically turned into an API that your developers can use. This allows you to use spreadsheets like a headless CMS for use in data tables, navigation, or feature comparisons, for example.
See the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information.
Preview and Publish Content
Once a document is created in Google Drive or Sharepoint, you can preview the corresponding web page and eventually publish the content to your production website.
The preview function is used to share pages with stakeholders before they are published and available to the general public on your website.
In order to preview, publish, or delete content, use the Sidekick that can be installed as a browser extension.
Ideally you receive a pre-configured link for your project from a fellow author, via the “Share Your Sidekick” function of the sidekick. This ensures that your sidekick is configured properly to edit and publish your project. See the Sidekick documentation for more information.
Preview
In Word or Google Docs, open the Sidekick, then click the “Preview” button. This will open a new browser window (check for the popup warning) that has the preview version of your site.
Although you can copy and share the URL of this preview, it is not meant for production. It does not have your domain name on it and is invisible to search engines. If the content is ready for publication, you can publish. If you need to make changes, open the Sidekick on the preview page and click “Edit” to go back to Word or Google Docs.
Publish
Publishing makes your content visible to everyone on the internet. To publish something, open the sidekick on a preview page (or follow the instructions above to open the preview again), then click “Publish”. After a few seconds, a new browser window will open, with your page on your public website.
Once your content has been published, it is visible to everyone on the internet, and search engines will be able to find it.
Delete
Generally, deleting published content and therefore removing publicly accessible resources from the web can be problematic because of inbound links from search, social, bookmarks and other referring sites. If a page is deleted that was once published, it is recommended to use redirects to make sure that incoming traffic for the deleted page is sent to the next best place. See the document Redirects for more information.
If you want to remove published content or just delete it from your site as part of a clean-up, doing so is a two-step process.
First, delete the source document from Sharepoint or Google Drive.
Alternatively you can rename the page or move it to a different folder, for example your drafts folder.
Alternatively you can rename the page or move it to a different folder, for example your drafts folder.
Then open the page you want to delete on the preview site and open the sidekick. There will be two options: Delete and Unpublish.
Unpublish removes it from the public production website, but keeps the preview.
Delete removes the preview, too.
Unpublish removes it from the public production website, but keeps the preview.
Delete removes the preview, too.
Deleting or unpublishing something is permanent and cannot be easily undone. If you want to undo a deletion, you have to restore the original document in Sharepoint or Google Drive and then publish it again.

https://www.aem.live/docs/bulk-metadata

Bulk Metadata
By default, metadata is managed at the page level. See Authoring and Publishing Content for more information.
In some cases, it is useful to apply metadata en masse to a website. Common use cases include:
A certain section of a website should look and feel different from the rest of the website (such as a different template or a different theme).
Default metadata such an og:image should be applied to portions of the website.
If a certain portion of the website should not be indexed by robots, the metadata can be used to set the robots meta tag to noindex for a portion of the site.
If you want to create metadata for many pages at once, create either an Excel workbook or a Google Sheets workbook in the root folder of your website in SharePoint or Google Drive.
Name the file metadata for Google Drive.
Name the file metadata.xlsx for SharePoint.
The workbook should have only one worksheet and at least two columns as in the following image.
The column titled URL has the URL pattern of the pages that should get a particular metadata entry.
The wildcard * (the asterisk) can be used as a prefix or suffix, allowing for flexible matches on the URL pathname. Typical examples include /docs/** or **/docs/**.
Note: The metadata sheet is evaluated from top to bottom, site wide meta data set to ** must be before more specific entries.
For each metadata property, create a column in the worksheet and name it using the property you want to assign. Typical examples include template, theme, or robots.
Page-level metadata added via a metadata block takes precedence over bulk metadata. See the documents Authoring and Publishing Content and Metadata (block) for more information.
To explicitly remove metadata a "" can be used as a value. This will remove the element or set the corresponding attribute to "" for a particular path.
Example:
The example above will remove the <link rel="canonical"> from all pages by default, unless there is a specific override for example from a page metadata block.
Note: You need to preview / publish the metadata sheet in order to see changes reflected on your page.
Tip: Excel can be slow to update inside SharePoint. If you do not see your changes reflected in preview or publish, hard refresh (click into URL bar and refresh) the Excel document in your browser and preview should work as expected.
Folder mapped Metadata
If the site has foldermapping configured, the metadata files within that folder will apply to all pages for that mapping. For example, if /templates is folder mapped to
/templates/default all metadata in /templates/default/metadata.xlsx will be applied after the global metadata to the pages below /templates.
Additional Metadata
When having metadata that is managed by several teams it is not practical to keep them all in the same metadata files. Multi metadata support is possible by configuring the all the metadata files that need to be taken into account in the /.helix/config.xlsx file:
The order of the entries in the list dictates the order of how the data is applied. The final order of the metadata is as follows:
If there is metadata configured in the /.helix/config.xlsx:
Page level metadata block wins over
Folder-mapped metadata sheet wins over
Metadata sheet(s) in configured order over
Blueprint metadata
if there is no configured order:
Page level metadata block wins over
Folder-mapped metadata sheet wins over
Global Metadata sheet (/metadata.xlsx)
Blueprint metadata
Note that individual metadata properties are overwritten but never deleted. For example, if the /metadata.json defines a property title, the same property in /metadata-2nd.json will overwrite the value, but only if it is not empty.

https://www.aem.live/docs/placeholders

Placeholders
In most websites, there are strings or variables that will be used throughout the site. Especially in sites that need to support multiple languages, it is not a good idea to hard code such values. Instead placeholders can be used and managed centrally.
Placeholders can be managed as a spreadsheet that is either in the root folder of the project or in the locales root folder in the case of a multilingual site.
Name the file placeholders for Google Docs.
Name the file placeholders.xlsx for SharePoint.
The spreadsheet has to contain at least two columns titled Key and Text.
The Key column is an identifier that is transformed automatically to be easily accessible via code.
The Text is the literal text (or string) for a placeholder with a given key.
After making changes to your placeholder spreadsheet, you can preview your changes via the sidekick and have your stakeholders check that the new placeholders are working on your .page preview website before publishing the placeholder changes to your production website. See the Sidekick documentation for more information about switching between environments.
Are you a developer and curious to learn how to use placeholders in your code? Look here.

https://www.aem.live/developer/sitemap

Sitemaps
Create automatically generated sitemap files to be referenced from your robots.txt. This helps with SEO and the discovery of new content. AEM can generate three types of sitemaps: without any configuration, based solely on a query index or based on a manual sitemap configuration.
Creating a Sitemap without any configuration
If you don’t do anything you will see your sitemap in sitemap.xml and have a sitemap index in sitemap.json. It will contain a list of all your published documents.
If you started with another type of sitemap and would like to switch to this type, you’ll have to delete the helix-sitemap.yaml configuration file - either manually defined in GitHub or automatically generated - and reindex your site.
Domain name used in external URLs
To customize the domain used in creating external URLs, add a property named host or cdn.prod.host in your project configuration (named .helix/config when using Google Drive as backend or .helix/config.xlsx on Sharepoint) and preview that file to activate it.
Generating a Sitemap configuration based on an index
Please see the document Indexing to learn more about indexing. In order to generate a sitemap configuration based on an index, please ensure that you have already set up an initial query index as explained there. This will generate a sitemap at the location:
https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/sitemap.xml
And a sitemap configuration at the following location:
https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/helix-sitemap.yaml
It is recommended that you create a sitemap-index.xml file that references all your sitemaps and keep that as part of your project code in your github repo. This way it is easy to add new sitemaps as the project expands.
Manual setup of your Sitemap configuration
If you need more customization than your generated sitemap configuration file provides, you can copy its contents and paste it into a file named helix-sitemap.yaml in the root folder of your project.
Note: When using a manually configured index and sitemap (e.g. your code repo includes a helix-query.yaml and helix-sitemap.yaml file) your index definition must include the robots property to ensure the sitemap excludes pages with robots: noindex metadata. When using auto-generated index definitions, simply follow the recommendations in the indexing documentation so those pages are excluded from the index.
The following sections contain the supported types of sitemaps.
Simple Sitemap
The following is a simple helix-sitemap.yaml. It assumes a single index containing all the pages that need to appear in the sitemap.
If you want last modification dates to be included in the URLs of your sitemap, add a lastmod property including a format to your configuration.
Multiple Sitemaps
It is common to have sitemaps per section of the sites and/or per country or language. AEM supports sitemaps including the corresponding hreflang references. In the following example we assume that there is a one to one mapping between the indexes and the sitemaps XML files.
If there are two pages in the english and french section that share a common suffix, they will be related, so e.g. if you have a page /welcome in the english section and a page /fr/welcome in the french section, the resulting entry in the /sitemap-en.xml will look like this:
A similar entry will be available in /sitemap-fr.xml.
Specifying the primary language manually
There might be situations where you have alternate versions of a page, but you’re unable to use a common suffix to identify them, possibly because you’re porting a legacy website that should not have its paths changed. In that situation, you can specify a primary-language-url for the alternate location, in the metadata of the document.
Let’s assume our primary language is english, we have a page /welcome in the english section and /fr/bienvenu in the french section, and the latter is an alternate version of the former.
First, we add that information to the document at /fr/bienvenu in its metadata:
This can also be added to a global metadata sheet, as shown in Bulk Metadata.
Then, we add an indexed property primary-language-url to the french index:
Finally, we re-publish the french page, and rebuild the sitemap.
Specifying the default language
Another common requirement is to specify the default language for a sitemap with multiple languages. This can be achieved by adding a property default in the sitemap:
In the resulting sitemap, all entries from the english subtree will have an extra alternate entry with hreflang x-default.
Specifying multiple hreflangs for one subtree
Sometimes, it is required to map multiple hreflangs to only one language subtree, e.g. consider we want the following to appear in the resulting sitemap:
Every page in our sitemap source should appear exactly once, but have multiple alternate hreflangs associated with it. In order to achieve this, you should specify an array of languages in the hreflang property:
Multiple Indexes Aggregated Into One Sitemap
There are cases where it is easier to have a single larger sitemap than fragmented small sitemaps, especially as there is a limit of sitemaps that can be submitted to search engines per site.
The following example shows how to aggregate a number of separate indexes into a single sitemap.
Using the same destination it is possible to combine multiple small sitemaps into one larger sitemap.
Including other sitemaps as input
In a mixed scenario, where not all languages in a sitemap are managed in AEM, you can include sitemaps from other language trees by specifying an XML path as source, as in:
In this example, we use an external french sitemap to calculate all sitemap locations. AEM will determine alternates for english sitemap URLs by deconstructing the french counterparts in external sitemap using the alternate definition.
Adding an extension to all locations in the sitemap
In a scenario, where you want all your locations to have an extension, e.g. .html, and you’re unable to generate a helix-sitemap sheet in your query index to derive a formula, you can add an extension to all languages or an individual language using an extension property:

https://www.aem.live/docs/setup-customer-sharepoint

How to use Sharepoint (application)
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint please continue here.
If you use SharePoint as your content source, AEM uses a registered Microsoft Azure application to access your content. This application has delegated permissions defined that allow the service to access SharePoint on behalf of a user. This user needs to be registered to the project that is using SharePoint.
Alternatively, the services can also authenticate as an application and use application permissions to access the sites. This needs additional setup by a SharePoint site administrator that can grant the permissions for the application.
The preferred setup is to use application permissions, as this narrows down the access the service has to a specific SharePoint site and does not require to share any secrets of a technical user. Also, it reduces the problems around password rotation.
The following describes how to set up application permissions for your project. If you want to set up a technical user, please continue here.
Setting up SharePoint involves the following steps:
Create or identify a Sharepoint site that will serve as site for the document based authoring
Create a folder within SharePoint that will be the website root.
Configure the fstab.yaml with the respective folder
Access the Registration Portal
Register the Application
Apply the sites.selected permission to the SharePoint site
1. Create or identify a Sharepoint site
Talk to your IT department to either identify or create a Sharepoint site that will be used for document based authoring. One site can “host” multiple websites (projects). This site will later receive the respective permissions so that the publishing services can access it.
2. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in the SharePoint site created or identified above and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a SharePoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
3. Configure the fstab.yaml
The next step is to configure the mountpoint in the fstab.yaml to point to the website root. It usually has the form of
But this might vary depending on how you create the SharePoint site and lists. In order to obtain the url, the simplest way is to copy-past the first part from the browser address, eg:
And then add the rest manually (Note, that copying the sharelink via the UI adds unnecessary information and it is better to use a canonical representation of the url). Once you composed the url, you can test it by entering it again in the browser. You should end up in the folder view of your website root.
After that, update the fstab.yaml accordingly.
For example:
To finalize the configuration, commit the fstab.yaml back to the main branch.
4. Access the Registration Portal
Overview
In order for the AEM service to access the authored content it needs a couple of information and setup. The AEM service (a cloud function) accesses the MS Graph API on behalf of an application (or configured user). In order to do so, it needs to authenticate first in the context of an Application. This is important because the scopes given to the application define what permission the service has on the MS Graph API. For example, it should be allowed to read and write documents, but not to alter access control.
An application is represented as an “Enterprise Application” in the respective Active Directory of a tenant. The permissions given to that enterprise application ultimately define what the service can access in that tenant’s resources. Certain permissions need to be approved by an Active Directory administrator before a user can use the application. This so-called “admin consent” is a mechanism to verify and control which permissions apps can have. This is to prevent dubious apps from tricking users into trusting an app that is not official. Having the extra admin consent step allows IT security to control which apps the employees can use.
1. Sign-in in the Registration Portal
View Enterprise Applications in Azure Portal
Assuming that so far no Franklin Enterprise Applications are present in Azure (Microsoft Entra Id)
Access Franklin Registration Portal
Go to https://admin.hlx.page/register, enter the github url of the project
Sign-in as non admin user
Sign in as a user that does not have admin permissions will show an error that it needs approval, i.e. the application needs admin consent.
Problem: Enterprise Application is not registered if a user never logs in.
Sign-in as admin user
One solution is to sign in as a user that does have admin permissions:
(note, at this point the Enterprise Application is still not registered in azure)
Franklin Registration Service visible in UI
If the admin logs in (without checking the checkbox and granting consent for everyone), the Enterprise application is present.
Create application using MSGraph or Powershell
Alternatively, you can create the Enterprise application via MSGraph or Powershell.
In order to make it visible in the azure UI you also need to add the WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp tag. This can be done directly when creating the application.Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
After that you still need to give admin consent, if you want a non admin user to login.
Also see:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-configure?pivots=ms-graph
Review permissions
Note that the Franklin Registration Service (e34c45c4-0919-43e1-9436-448ad8e81552) application is only needed during registration to verify that the user has read access to the sharepoint. It has the following delegated permissions:
OpenidAllows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information.
ProfileAllows the app to see your users' basic profile (e.g., name, picture, user name, email address)
Files.ReadWrite.AllAllows the app to read, create, update and delete all files the signed-in user can access.
User logged in Registration portal
After completing this initial step, the user is logged in the registration portal
Adding the Franklin Service with application permissions
Add Enterprise Application
When logged in the registration portal, the content source that is used by the project needs to be connected to an oauth grant for the Franklin Service application. This is needed, so that the system can access the documents in sharepoint and convert them to an internal format (markdown) and store it in Adobe’s storage (S3/R2) for fast delivery.
Using application sites.selected permissions is more secure as it limits the scope to a single sharepoint site. In order to connect, click on the Connect Application button.
If you never registered an application or a user before, you probably see the following error:
Same as above, the Enterprise application for the Franklin Service (83ab2922-5f11-4e4d-96f3-d1e0ff152856) is not present in Azure yet,In order to add it, use the graph explorer or powershell to add it:
Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
Also see:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant
Add Application Roles
Now the enterprise application Franklin Service is visible in azure. But it doesn’t have any Sites.Selected application permissions.
Problem: Using the admin consent UI would grant all application and delegated permissions, which we don’t want.
An easy way is to consent to all permissions and then remove the delegated ones again.
Add Application Roles using Powershell or Graph Explorer
Alternatively, adding the app roles can be done with the following steps:
Find the service principal of the enterprise application (principalId). This is the one you created above.
Find the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API (resourceId)
Find the Id for the Sites.Selected Application Role (appRoleId)
Assign the Application Role to the Managed Identity (The Enterprise Application)
Using powershell this can be done with:
Using graph explorer it involves more steps:
Find the principal of the enterprise application for Franklin Service :
This will be our principalId
Find the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API
This is the resourceId. (the resource that defines the application role)
Find the id of the application role.GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/${resourceId}/appRoles
Substitute the resourceId with the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API as obtained from the previous step.
This Id is the appRoleId
Assign the Application Role to the Managed Identity. The request has the format:
Validate Permissions
Eventually you should see the granted application permission in the UI.
Back in the registration portal, the should have changed to:
(note, at the time of writing, this message is not very accurate, it should read:The resource specified in the fstab.yaml does either not exist, or you do not have permission to access it. Please make sure that the url is correct, the enterprise application: "Franklin Service (83ab2922-5f11-4e4d-96f3-d1e0ff152856)" is granted to access the configured sharepoint site via the “Sites.Selected” permissions.
Add permissions to Sharepoint Site
In order to add the permissions to the sharepoint site, we need to find its SiteId.
This can be done using again the graph explorer:
Example:
Using the Id we can set the permissions:
Note: If you get an “Access Denied” error while executing the above request , you need to have “Site Admin” permissions in order to run the above step. Also you may need to give additional “consent” from the Graph Explorer’s “Modify Permissions” panel for additional “Sites” scopes.

https://www.aem.live/docs/go-live-checklist

Go-Live Checklist
The go-live checklist is a summary of best practices to consider when launching a website. These steps are generally good practices but have some aspects specific to Adobe Experience Manager.
Steps Before Go-Live
Content and Design QA
Make sure that your content and design conforms to the specifications and that you are happy with the website you see on your projects .hlx.live domain. This may include checks for specific accessibility and SEO requirements of your project.
Performance Validation
Every AEM project should produce a lighthouse score of 100 for mobile and desktop from Google Pagespeed insights on its respective .hlx.live site.
See the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information.
Analytics Validation
Make sure that all your analytics setup and the rest of your martech stack is firing as expected and visitor data is visible in your reporting dashboards.In any relaunch of a website the analytics instrumentation will change based on loading sequence and performance.
It is important to expect that the baseline of any metric captured by analytics will change. Contact the corresponding analysts to make sure that the adjustment of the baseline is understood and expected.
Metrics that may change their baselines as reported by analytics may include pageviews, conversion rates, bounce rates, time on page, etc. Depending on the change in loading patterns the baseline of the metrics may go up and down.Bottom of the funnel metrics like checkout, transactions or form submission that are captured by operational systems are not affected and are expected to stay flat past a lift-and-shift launch.
RUM instrumentation
To be able to see performance impact quickly and reliably and to compare before / after launch metrics we recommend instrumenting your website before launch with Real Use Monitoring (RUM), ideally as early as possible. Adding RUM to your existing site is trivial and can give you important operational insights even before launch.
Legacy Redirects
In most migrations there are legacy URLs that are retired. Make sure those are reflected in your redirects spreadsheet (redirects.xlsx in sharepoint or redirects in google), found in your project content folder. Check Google Search Console for the most impactful backlinks (in terms of SEO) to create redirects for.
See the document Redirects for more information.
Sitemap & Robots
For most websites with a significant number of pages, a sitemap is desirable. AEM automatically generates sitemaps from the query index. For multilingual sites, adding hreflang to the sitemap ensures that the website correctly targets the appropriate geographic and language audience, which is essential for SEO and prevents issues like duplicate content across different language versions (aka SEO cannibalisation) and improves the search engine's ability to serve the right version of the content to the right users.
If you have a sitemap that’s generated for your site make sure it is discoverable from your robots.txt. ​​Note that robots.txt is (technically) case sensitive, and a good example is:
Note: hlx.page and hlx.live are kept hidden from crawlers intentionally, to avoid duplicate content.
See the documents Indexing and Sitemaps for more information.
Canonical URLs
Make sure canonical URLs return 2xx HTML response status code (not 3xx or 4xx) and that they are correctly implemented, which is crucial for preventing duplicate content issues across the site. Proper canonicalization helps search engines understand which versions of similar pages to index and display in search results, directly impacting SEO performance.
See the following external documentation for more information: Consolidate duplicate urls
Favicon
Adding a favicon to your site gives it a professional look in your visitor’s browsers.
See the document Favicon for more information.
Authentication for Authors
By default, authors don’t need to be logged in to use AEM Sidekick. If you decide you want to control who can preview and publish documents this can be configured.
See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.
SharePoint Access
If your content is in SharePoint, follow this guide to configure dedicated access which you control.
CDN Configuration
One of the last steps in a go-live is usually to update your CDN configuration (e.g. Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai, Cloudfront) to point to your hlx.live endpoint.
Ideally the CDN configuration is tested in a staging environment to make sure that everything works as expected, which includes redirects from www to APEX and vice-versa.
Please see the following CDN setup documentation for more information.
Cloudflare Worker Setup Guide
Akamai Setup Guide
Cloudfront Setup Guide
Fastly Setup Guide
Push Invalidation Setup
Make sure push invalidation is properly set up according to the document Configuring Push Invalidation for BYO Production CDN. Test the setup by publishing a small change and verifying that the change is visible on the production domain.
Update Production Host
After setting up your production CDN, add the host property to the sidekick configuration in /tools/sidekick/config.json in your github repo, to allow your authors to navigate directly from the production domain to edit directly from the sidekick.
See the document Sidekick Configuration for more information.
Post Go-Live Validation
Performance Validation
Validate that the performance is still at a lighthouse score of 100 via pagespeed insights on the production environment. Introducing a CDN layer can have adverse performance effects that are usually visible on the protocol layer. Typical culprits are running HTTP/1.1 or ineffective origin caching as well as bot detection or other libraries injected by the CDN configuration.
Google Search Console
If you have an active Google Search Console with your sitemap uploaded, it may be valuable to get a coverage report and make sure that indexing works as expected. The Google Search Console should be monitored for the weeks after a go-live to track the indexing status of new and updated pages, ensuring they are properly recognized by Google. It's crucial to check for total clicks, total impressions, backlinks changes and crawl errors, as these can significantly impact the site's SEO performance and authority.
404 Report
After a website has been migrated there is usually a set of 404 Not Founds, which should be monitored after the go-live and redirected to popular page URLs. This information can be pulled from your site analytics and the respective Slack bot report. Monitoring this for the weeks after a go-live is recommended.

Configuring push invalidation for BYO production CDN
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Setting up push invalidation requires 2 steps:
Configuration
Opt-In Request Header
Configuration
Push invalidation is currently supported for CDNs of the following vendors:
Fastly
Akamai
Cloudflare
CloudFront
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
The following sections describe the vendor specific properties required to set up push invalidation.
Fastly
Configuration properties:

Cloudflare Setup
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Cloudflare to deliver content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
This setup can be completely done in the browser by using the Cloudflare Dashboard only. If you are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler & GitHub and not afraid of entering commands in a terminal window you might want to follow the instructions for Cloudflare with wrangler instead.
Create a Cloudflare site
If you already have a Cloudflare site and DNS set up you can skip forward to the Setup push invalidation section.
Enter the domain:
Select a plan:
Note that surgical push invalidations are only supported on the Enterprise plan. On all other plans the entire cache of the site will be purged every time an author publishes a content change.For this walk-through we’ll use the Free plan.

Note that only sites on the enterprise plan will be surgically purged by url and cache key. A Purge All will be performed instead on non-enterprise sites every time an author publishes a content change.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
For a new site, we’ll start with a simple DNS setup.
Create a new CNAME record. If your zone is mysite.com and you want to serve traffic on www.mysite.com, then the name should be www
If you want to serve traffic on example.com (without a www) then the name should be @
And if you want to serve traffic on all subdomains, then the name should be *
As we are using workers to serve the content, the value of the Content field does not matter. It’s easiest to use your ref--repo--owner.aem.live host name here. This is a hostname, not a URL, so leave out the leading https://
Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied:
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list. On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable the setting:
Configure Caching
Navigate to Caching → Configuration and adjust following settings:
Caching Level: Standard
Browser Cache TTL: Respect Existing Headers
Create Cache Rules
Next browse to Caching → Cache Rules and create a new cache rule
Note: Enable Origin Cache Control option is only available for enterprise accounts. Free, Pro, and Business customers have this option enabled by default and cannot disable it.
Following settings should apply:
When incoming requests match: hostname contains mydomain.com
Then: Eligible for cache
Under Browser TTL, click "add setting", then apply "Respect Origin TTL"
Create Worker
Return to the Cloudflare Dashboard homepage, then navigate the sidebar: Workers & Pages → Overview. Click "create" to create a new worker.
On the next screen, click "create worker", because that's what you want to achieve.
Enter a name for the worker (e.g. aem-worker) and click on “Deploy”:
On the next screen, click "Edit code"
Edit worker code
Copy the content of this file.
In the left pane, replace the existing content with the copied content.
Click on “Deploy”
Confirm with "Save and Deploy"
Return to your worker (by clicking the back arrow in the top right corner), then click on Settings → Variables and “Add variable”:Add a variable ORIGIN_HOSTNAME and set the value to the hostname of your origin (e.g. main--mysite--aemsites.aem.live):
If you have enabled push invalidation, add a second environment variable PUSH_INVALIDATION = enabled.
Apply the changes by clicking "Deploy".
Next, click on Triggers an select “Add route”:
Enter your domain route (e.g. www.mydomain.com/*), select your zone and confirm with “Add route”:
Depending on the setup chosen in DNS Setup, you would select routes www.mydomain.com/* or mydomain.com/*
Warning: if you select *.mydomain.com/* as Cloudflare suggests in the field default, your site will be available under multiple subdomains. This will invite attackers trying to open webmail.mydomain.com and similar sites, and lead to duplicate content, potentially depressing your search engine rankings.After completing all steps you should be all set.
Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
When using token-based Site Authentication, add the following to enable authenticated requests from Cloudflare to AEM.
Return to Workers → <your worker> → Settings → Variables
Create a new environment variable ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION
Paste the site token value from token-based Site Authentication (it starts with hlx_)
Confirm by clicking "Deploy"
Expanding the AEM footprint on your website
In case you start with having only a portion of the website being routed to your .live origin and have routed a specific folder (eg. /blog/*) you can subsequently add more routes whenever you are ready to expose new sections of the site by simply adding more routes and repeat the last “add route” steps as needed, without changing your worker configuration.
Watch out for duplicate content
Search engines often penalize sites for duplicate content, so it's important to make sure your content is not available on the web elsewhere. Cloudflare, unfortunately, has a default setting that will expose your site on additional network ports. In paid Cloudflare plans you can block traffic on these additional ports. This is a recommended setting for production sites.

Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
When using token-based Site Authentication, add the following under "Add Behavior: Outgoing Request Headers"
Configuration properties:
This setting will ensure that Akamai authenticates requests from your CDN to the AEM Origin, which validates the token received in the Authorization header.
Caveats
Do not enable Akamai mPulse Real Usage Monitoring. While the performance impact on most sites is negligible, for sites built for consistent high performance, enabling it will prevent reaching a Lighthouse Score of 100. In AEM, you have a Real Use Monitoring service built-in, so that dual instrumentation will be unnecessary and is strongly discouraged.
Also, do not enable Akamai Bot Manager or similar Web Application Firewall offerings, as they markedly interfere with rendering performance and user experience. Your site on AEM is protected against bot attacks on the backend, so that this performance cost comes with negligible benefit.

Note
Your Fastly setup should not use Fastly’s Next Generation Web Application Firewall for requests that are going against aem.live or any other Edge Delivery Services origin. Enabling WAF with Edge Delivery Services can lead to erroneous content being delivered.
Edge Delivery Services needs no Web Application Firewall, as it is running on hardened, shared, and ultra-scalable infrastructure. Requests that a WAF would typically intercept are terminated in our CDNs.

Redirects
Every website has the need for redirects. For example if you relocate or delete content, you want your users to still be able to find it or the next best thing. See the document Authoring and Publishing Content for more information on deleting content.
You can intuitively manage redirects as a spreadsheet called redirects (or redirects.xlsx) in the root of your project folder.
The spreadsheet has to contain at least two columns titled Source and Destination.
The Source is relative to the domain of your website, so it only contains the relative path.
The Destination can be either a fully qualified URL if you are redirecting to a different website, or it can be a relative path if you are redirecting within your own website.
After making changes to your redirects spreadsheet, you can preview your changes via the sidekick and have your stakeholders check that the redirects are working on your .page preview website before publishing the redirect changes to your production website. See the Sidekick documentation for more information about switching between environments.Redirects take precedence over existing content, which means that if you have an existing page with a given URL, defining a redirect for that same URL will serve the redirect for that page and “hide” the existing page. Conversely if a redirect that has been set up on an existing page is removed, the existing page will be served again, unless the page was unpublished.
Remember that if your redirect workbook has multiple pages (worksheets), then the redirects will only work on the sheet that is called helix-default. This allows you to manage more complex redirects through spreadsheet formulas. The spreadsheets and JSON documentation page has all the details.

What is the Sidekick Library?
The Sidekick Library is an extension for the AEM Sidekick that enables developers to create UI-driven tooling for content authors. It includes a built-in blocks plugin that can display a list of all blocks to authors in an intuitive manner, removing the need for authors to remember or search for every variation of a block. Developers can also write their own plugins for the sidekick library.
How to use the Sidekick Library?
The steps below detail how to setup the sidekick library and configure the blocks plugin.
Library Sheet Setup
The sidekick library is populated with your plugins and plugin content using a sheet.
1. Start by creating a directory in sharepoint or gdrive where you want to store the content for the library. We recommend storing the content in /tools/sidekick (or any other name) in the root of the mountpoint. The next steps will assume the directory is called /tools/sidekick.
2. Next, create a workbook (an Excel file) in the /tools/sidekick directory called library (or any other name). Each sheet in the workbook represents a plugin that will be loaded by the Sidekick Library. The name of the sheet determines the name of the plugin that will be loaded. Any data contained in the sheet will be passed to the plugin when loaded. The plugin sheet name must be prepended with helix-. For example, if you want to load a plugin called tags, you would create a sheet named helix-tags.
3. For this tutorial we will create a sheet for our blocks plugin. Create a sheet (or rename the default sheet) and call it `helix-blocks` and leave it empty for now.
Blocks Plugin
The Sidekick library comes with a blocks plugin.
Blocks Plugin Setup
To generate content for the blocks plugin, you need to prepare a separate Word document for each block you want to include.
1. Create a directory inside the /tools/sidekick directory where you will store all the block variations. For example, you could create a directory called blocks inside /tools/sidekick.2. For this example, let's assume we want to define all the variations of a block called columns. First create a Word document called columns inside the blocks directory and provide examples of all the variations of the columns block. After each variation of the block add in a section delimiter.3. Preview and publish the columns document.4. Open the library workbook created in the last section, inside the helix-blocks sheet, create two columns named name and path.6. Next we need to add a row for our columns block. Add the name of the block in the first column and the url to the document that defines the block variations in the second column. For instance, if you want to add the columns block, you could create a row with the name Columns and the path /tools/sidekick/blocks/columns. In order for the library to work across environments (page, live, prod) you should not use an absolute url for the path column.7. Preview and publish the library workbook.
> Since the example blocks are being published you should use bulk metadata to exclude the content inside of /tools/** from being indexed.
Example library.xlsx
Library Metadata
The blocks plugins supports a special type of block called library metadata which provides a way for developers to tell the blocks plugin some information about the block or how it should be rendered.
Supported library metadata options
Default Library metadata vs Library metadata
There are two types of library metadata. Library metadata that lives within a section containing the block, or default library metadata that applies to the document as a whole and lives in a section on it's own (a block called library metadata as the only child in a section).
Let's take an example of a hero block that has 5 variants. Suppose you want to add the same description for each variation of the block, rather than duplicating the library metadata with the description into each section containing the variations. You could instead use default library metadata to apply the same description to every variation of the block. If you decide that one variation actually needs a slightly different description you could add library metadata to the section containing the variation and it would override the default library metadata description when it's rendered within the blocks plugin.
Authoring block names and descriptions using Library Metadata
By default the block name (with variation) will be used to render the item in the blocks plugin. For example, if the name of the block is columns (center, background) then that name will be used as the label when it’s rendered in the blocks plugin. This can be customized by creating a library metadata section within the same section as the block. Library metadata can also be used to author a description of the block as well as adding searchTags to include an alias for the block when using the search feature.
Example block with custom name and description
Content
Display
Autoblocks and Default Content
The blocks plugin is capable of rendering default content and autoblocks. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to place your default content or autoblock within a dedicated section, which should include a library metadata table defining a name property, as previously described. If no name is specified in the library metadata, the item will be labeled as "Unnamed Item."
Blocks composed of content in subsequent sections
There are situations where developers may want a block to consist of content from subsequent sections. This pattern is discouraged for reasons stated here, but if you choose to use it the blocks plugin can render these items using the include next sections property in library metadata.
Templates
Templates are a way to group an entire document into a single element in the sidekick library. To mark a document as a template set type to template in default library metadata.
> Important, the library metadata needs to be in it's own section and be the only child to be considered default library metadata.
Supporting metadata is also desirable for templates. To add a metadata table to the template you can use a Page metadata block.
When the template is copied a metadata with the values will be added along with the content to the clipboard.
Sidekick plugin setup
Since the sidekick library is hosted on the same origin as the content, a static HTML page needs to be created to load and configure the content.
1. Create a file called library.html in tools/sidekick/;
2. Paste the following code in library.html.
In the code above we load the sidekick library from aem.live and then create a custom sidekick-library element and add it to the page. The sidekick-library element accepts a config object that is required to configure the sidekick library.
Supported configuration parameters
The blocks plugin supports the following configuration properties that can be set using the plugins object.
Blocks plugin configuration parameters
Examples
Encoding images
Custom viewports (short form)
Custom viewports
Custom table header colors
You can customize the table header background and foreground color when pasting a block, section metadata or metadata that was copied from the blocks plugin.
Default styles can be set in library.html using css variables.
These values can be overridden using library metadata.
> Depending on the system color scheme selected for the users computer (dark mode), Word may alter the chosen colors in an attempt to improve accessibility.
Custom plugin setup
The example below defines a tags plugin in the config. The keys of the plugins object must match the name of the plugin, any other properties defined in the plugin object will be available to the plugin via the context argument of the decorate method.
Extended Libraries
In some cases merging two block libraries may be desirable. When an extended library is defined the sidekick library application will merge the base library and the extended library together into a single library list for authors.
The example below defines a base library and an extended library (on another origin) that will be merged into the base library.
> The Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers will need to be set on the library.json and blocks of the extended library in order for them to load in the sidekick library. See Custom HTTP Response Headers for more info.
> Due to same-origin policies enforced by browsers on iframes a preview of an extended block cannot be loaded at this time.
Sidekick config.json setup
Next, in order for the sidekick library to appear in the sidekick a config file needs to be created at tools/sidekick/config.json. This config file needs to be created in the code bus and should be checked into github.
The url property in the plugin configuration indicates the location from which the sidekick should load the plugin. This should point to the library.html file we previously created.
> The sidekick config must be checked into the main branch in order to for the plugin to appear in the sidekick.
> If the tools/sidekick/config.json file does not exist in your github repository, it must be created. For more information on sidekick plugin configuration options, see the docs.
Considerations when building blocks for the library
The sidekick library renders blocks by first fetching the plain.html rendition of the the block and then strips it of any other blocks in the content (for example if there are multiple variations of a block in the response). It then requests the same page (without .plain.html) and replaces the main element with the stripped block and loads the entire document into an iframe using the srcdoc attribute.
Use of window.location
Since the block is loaded in an iframe using the srcdoc attribute, the instance of the window.location object used by your sites code will not contain the typical values you would expect to see.
Example window.location object when running in the library
For this reason, if your block requires use of the window.location object we recommend adding the following functions to your scripts.js file and importing them into your function for use.
Use of createOptimizedPicture in lib-aem
The createOptimizedPicture function in lib-aem also uses window.location.href. If you are using this function we recommend moving it into scripts.js and modify it to use the getHref() function above.
Checking for the presence of the sidekick library
Sometimes you may want to know if the page or the block is running in the sidekick library. To do this there are a couple of options.
1. Check if window.location.href === 'about:srcdoc'
2. The main element and the block element will contain the sidekick-library class
Building a Plugin
Developing a plugin is similar to constructing a block in AEM. Once a user tries to load the plugin, the sidekick library will trigger the decorate() method on your plugin. This method receives the container to render the plugin in and any data that is included in the plugins sheet.
> The decorate() function must be exported from the plugin.
Plugin default export & search
The default export from a plugin allows authors to customize the plugin name displayed in the header upon loading, as well as activate the search functionality within the sidekick library.
When the searchEnabled property is true, the library header will display a search icon upon loading the plugin. If the user initiates a search by entering a query, the decorate() function of the plugin will be triggered again, this time with the search string passed in the query parameter of the decorate() function.
Plugin web components
Plugin authors can utilize a select set of web components from Spectrum when building a custom plugin.
The following components from Spectrum are available
The following icons from Spectrum are also available
Plugin Events
Plugin authors can dispatch events from their plugin to the parent sidekick library in order to display a loader or to show a toast message.

Picking the right CDN
A Content Delivery Network makes sure that your visitors get your site served as fast as possible when entering your domain name. Adobe Experience Manager integrates with many popular CDN choices, but if you are unsure which one to pick, answer the questions below
Questionnaire
Cloudflare (Enterprise)
AEM customers use Cloudflare Enterprise and benefit from fast and fine-granular purging, powerful extensibility with Cloudflare Workers, support for multiple backends, and zero-trust security support. It's also an all-around good CDN.
Learn how to set up Cloudflare for Adobe Experience Manager
Cloudflare (Free)
Cloudflare's free option is a great choice for smaller sites, as the free tier comes with included traffic and support for Cloudflare Workers. It does not support key-based purging, which means for some updates Adobe Experience Manager has to purge the entire site, making Cloudflare free unsuitable for large sites with frequent content updates.
Learn how to set up Cloudflare for Adobe Experience Manager
Cloudfront
Cloudfront is the CDN that is included in your Amazon Web Services contract. It is a passable CDN that is supported by Adobe Experience Manager, but many important features are missing such as support for fine-granular content purges. This makes Cloudfront unsuitable for sites with lots of content and a high frequency of updates
If this does not discourage you, here is how to set up Cloudfront for Adobe Experience Manager
Fastly (self-managed)
If you are already a Fastly customer, then you know why Adobe Experience Manager integrates with it out of the box: a rock-solid and blazingly fast CDN with fine-grained push invalidation that you can configure using Fastly's VCL language.
Learn how to set up Fastly for Adobe Experience Manager
Fastly (AEM Cloud Service)
Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service bundles the Fastly CDN, which means it's likely included in your contract. Advanced configuration options require using configuration pipelines in Cloud Manager, so you combine the best of YAML with VCL.
Learn how to set up Fastly for Adobe Experience Manager
Fastly (Adobe Commerce)
As an Adobe Commerce customer, you have access to the Fastly CDN. It's a great choice of CDN, rock-solid, blazingly fast, and, thanks to VCL, extremely configurable with plenty of public documentation.
Learn how to set up Fastly for Adobe Experience Manager
Akamai
Akamai is the market-leading CDN and if you are a customer, there is no reason not to use it with Adobe Experience Manager. Akamai supports push invalidation at reasonable speed and can combine sites with multiple backends, which helps when migrating a legacy site to fast edge delivery.
Set up Akamai for Adobe Experience Manager in 13 easy steps.
BYO DNS
Sometimes you don't need a CDN at all. Adobe allows you to use the BYO DNS service, which provides caching and push invalidation, has secure certificates, but does not provide any configuration options. All you need to do is point your DNS records to Adobe and tell us which site you want to serve under your domain.
Bring your own DNS (without a custom CDN) to Adobe Experience Manager

https://www.aem.live/docs/byo-cdn-setup

BYO CDN Setup
Customers may use their own CDN to deliver AEM content under their own domain (aka BYO Production CDN). While customers are generally free to configure their CDN according to their own needs there are some settings mandated/recommended by Adobe Experience Manager:
Origin urlhttps://main--<yoursite>--<yourorg>.hlx.live
Headers sent to origin
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(optional, see Configuring Push Invalidation)
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(optional, see Configuring Push Invalidation)
Origin cache controlI.e. Cache TTL on the production CDN is controlled via origin cache control response headers. This should be enabled (if available).
Compression (gzip)Should be enabled
Query parameters
Must be forwarded to origin
Must be included in cache key
Must be forwarded to origin

Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudFront Setup
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure AWS CloudFront to deliver content from an AEM origin. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Setup push invalidation for AWS Cloudfront
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
NB: CloudFront does NOT support purging by cache tag/key. Purge by cache tag/key always triggers a purge all.Configuration properties:
To create the AWS credentials:
In the AWS Console, open the IAM dashboard:
Select Policies -> Create policy:
Select “CloudFront” as Service, “CreateInvalidation” as Action, then click on “Add ARN”:
Enter you Distribution Id and click on “Add”:
Proceed to “Next: Tags” and then “Next: Review”.Enter a name for the new policy, e.g. “Invalidate<Your Distribution Id>”, and click on “Create policy”:
In the IAM dashboard, select Users -> Add users:
Enter a user name (e.g. “Invalidator”) and click on Next:
On the “Set permissions” pane, select “Attach policies directly” and select the newly created policy (“Invalidate<Your Distribution Id>” in our example):
Proceed to the next step, click on “Create user” end then “View user”:
Select the “Security credentials” tab and click on “Create access key”:
Select “Third-party service”, click the checkbox and proceed to “Next”:
Finally, copy the Access key ID and Secret access key values:
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
Create a CloudFront distribution
Configure the origin
Use main--sitename--orgname.aem.live as the Origin domain.
Add following custom headers:
X-Forwarded-Host: your domain name
X-BYO-CDN-Type: cloudfront
If you have successfully configured push invalidation for your project you should also add the following custom header:
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled

Select whether you want to enable a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Your AEM origin requires no WAF and use of a WAF is neither required nor recommended for AEM origins.
Scroll to the end of the page and click "create distribution". We need to return to the configuration later, so remember the ID of your distribution.
Create Function to remove Age and X-Robots-Tag headers
In the Cloudfront sidebar, select "Functions" and click "Create function".
Enter a name for the function (e.g. stripHeaders), an optional description and click on “Create Function”:
Replace the code of the function with the following snippet and click on “Save changes”:
Select the "Publish" tab and click on “Publish function”:
Finally, associate the function with your distribution by scrolling down to "Associated distributions" and click "Add association".
In the following dialog, select:
Distribution: the ID of your new distribution
Event type: viewer response
Cache behavior: default
Finally, click "add association"
That’s all (more or less). Please test the distribution in a stage environment.
Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
If you have enabled token-based Site Authentication, go back to Cloudfront → Distributions → <your distribution> → Origins → <your AEM origin> → Edit
Under "Add custom header", select "add header" and create a header Authorization with value token <your-auth-token>. Replace <your-auth-token> with the token value created through token-based Site Authentication (it starts with hlx_) as the header value.
This will ensure that all requests from the AWS Cloudfront CDN to your AEM origin use the correct authorization.

Configuring Site Authentication
AEM Live supports token-based authentication. Site authentication is usually applied to both the preview and publish sites, but can also be configured to only protect either site individually.
Warning
Enabling Site Authentication for the publish sites (*.aem.live) will enforce authentication for all your site visitors (intranet). It will also prevent automatic PSI (Page Speed Insights) checks from running on your pull requests in GitHub. For use cases where your BYO CDN should use no (or different) authentication from your .live origin, you will need to configure preview only authentication or bypass authentication with an API_KEY.
If you use authentication, your BYO (production) CDN must not use (disable) caching, otherwise authentication is gradually circumvented.
Limitations
Only authentication is supported. Authorization is not supported.
Authentication can only be enabled or disabled for the entire site
It is not possible to create a custom error page for denied access
Enable Authentication for the Preview and Publish Sites
1. Enable the Configuration Service
All of the following instructions use the Configuration Service for your site, so follow the linked instructions to enable and authenticate, then perform the following API requests.
2. Create a token to access your protected site
POST an empty body to http://admin.hlx.page/config/{org}/sites/{site}/tokens.json the response will be a JSON object containing an id and value field. Remember both, you'll need them for the next steps:
Note that you now have two tokens:
The auth token for the admin API. This one is highly sensitive
The site token, which can be shared with users and systems than need to access your site
3. Enable the token to access your site
POST to http://admin.hlx.page/config/{org}/sites/{site}/access/site.json so that accessing your site on aem.page and aem.live requires the token value you've retrieved in the previous step.
The response contains all token IDs that are currently valid. Each POST request resets the list of tokens, so if you want old tokens to remain valid, make sure to perform a GET request to the same URL before, so your list of tokens remains complete.
The example above sets the site property which controls access to both aem.page and aem.live. This is the most restrictive approach. If you want to limit access to both aem.page and aem.live, POST to site.json. If you want to limit access to aem.page only, post to preview.json. In the unlikely case that you want to limit access to aem.live only, and keep aem.page open, post to live.json.
If you have set tokens for live and either preview or live, then preview and live will override the site-wide settings.
4. Verify that access has been limited
When you open your site in your browser, you will see an HTTP 401 status code, indicating that no access is possible without authentication. Next, try to access the site and provide the token value:
In this request we use the site token value in the Authorization header.
5. Make your CDN pass the right Authorization header
With this change, nobody can access your site without the correct authorization header. This includes your CDN, and therefore every visitor to your site. To enable access again, you need to add the Authorization header to each origin request your CDN makes.
The CDN setup instructions explain how to enable the authorization header for each supported Content Delivery Network.
Browser Access to the Protected Sites
Accessing protected sites directly from a browser requires users to have an appropriate role defined in the project configuration and to sign in using the AEM Sidekick Extension.

https://www.aem.live/docs/config-service-setup

Setting up the configuration service
The Configuration Service is used to aggregate and deliver configuration for various consumers in the AEM architecture including: Client, Delivery, HTML Pipeline, and Admin Service.
Configurations stored in the client scope can be consumed from your site or the AEM Sidekick and control functionality and behavior for visitors and authors. All other configurations are internal to the AEM infrastructure and cannot be accessed directly.
The configuration is managed using REST calls to the Admin service (admin.hlx.page). See AEM Admin API for details of the API.
For existing AEM projects (coming from hlx.live) projects, the configuration service aggregates a valid configuration based on the various sources (fstab.yaml, .helix/config.xlsx, etc). This ensures backward compatibility, but means that some features are not available in this document mode (the traditional, distributed configuration).
One of the new features that the configuration service can support is independent code and content definitions per site. A site is a combination of an org name and a site name. This is similar to the GitHub owner and repo tuple, but has no longer a relation to the GitHub project.
For example, a site named website of the org acme could have a code repository adobe/helix-website. The preview URL follows the same scheme, but using site and org instead. In this example: https://main--website--acme.aem.page. (also notice the new 2nd level domain name, aem).
With this new mechanism, it is now possible to have multiple sites that use different content, but use the same code repository. This feature is also known as “repoless”.
Prerequisites
There are some rules and constraints when creating new setups that use the configuration service
Any aem.live organization needs also to exist as github.com org and at least one repository needs to be synced to the Code Bus using AEM Code Sync. This ensures that the organization namespace is properly claimed by an entity that can also claim an org on github.com.
For projects that want to use multiple sites with the same code repository (repoless), there must be one canonical site for which the organization/site matches the github owner/repo. This is required for proper code-config association and CDN push invalidation.
Configuration Example
In this example we will create two new sites, website and products of the acme org, which will both share the same github repository: acme/website. The content is managed in sharepoint, at a fictitious https://acme.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/website and .../products.
We assume that the acme org is already set up and a user was defined that can manage the site configurations.
1. Create new configuration for the first site
Make sure that you are properly authenticated, then using the Admin API, we create the first site:
The new site is now available at https://main--website--acme.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed yet.
2. Create new configuration for the second site
Using the Admin API, we create the second site:
The new site is now available at https://main--products--acme.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed.
Updating a site's configuration
You can update the site configuration either as a whole document, or only certain sub-structures. For example, to give user bob configuration-admin rights:
Other examples
Update Code Location
Update Production CDN
Update Headers
Update Folders
Use this for updating the folder mappings.
Update Public Custom Configuration
The public configuration can also be accessed via the site host https://main--website--acme.aem.page/config.json.
Remove unused configuration files
Once you have enabled the configuration service, the configuration settings there supplant the settings you have in configuration files in your GitHub repository and your content source, so it is best to remove them:
First remove the files from github:
fstab.yaml
robots.txt
tools/sidekick/config.json
helix-query.yaml
helix-sitemap.yaml
And after those are removed, check if the hlx.page preview page returns a 404. This means that the internal configuration of the repository based config is cleaned up. Then you can also unpreview and delete the configuration in /.helix folder in your content:
.helix/config.xlsx
.helix/headers.xlsx

https://www.aem.live/docs/repoless

One codebase, many sites
If you have many similar sites that mostly look and behave the same, but have different content, you may want to share code across multiple sites. In the past, the best way to do this was to create multiple GitHub repositories, keep them somehow in sync, and run each site off a dedicated GitHub repository.
AEM supports running multiple sites from the same codebase without having to take care of code replication. This ability is also known as "repoless", because all but your first site don't need a GitHub repository of their own.
Follow this document to learn how to create and manage multiple sites off the same codebase. Make sure you have followed the developer tutorial, as it provides the basics of creating a site on AEM.
How this works
Repoless sites are enabled by the Configuration Service in Adobe Experience Manager, which introduces a couple of concepts such as Organization, Profile, Repository, Site, and Content Source. The following diagram shows how the pieces fit together.
Organization
Each site in Adobe Experience Manager belongs to an organization. This organization has the same name as an org on github.com, so that there is no naming conflict. An organization can have multiple sites, profiles, and users.
Profile
Profiles are a way to group and re-use important configurations such as headers, indexes, additional metadata, and so on. A profile can be used by multiple sites within an organization, so that there is consistency among them.
GitHub Repository
For each codebase in Adobe Experience Manager, there is one GitHub repository. By creating a first site that uses this repository through AEM Code Sync, this code will be made available to Adobe Experience Manager and can then be used by multiple sites. When updates are pushed to the GitHub repository, they apply to all sites that use this codebase.
Site
A site combines content, code, and configuration to create a new web experience. Configuration can be attached directly to the site, or it can be referenced from a profile. While a profile can be used by multiple sites, each site can have only one profile. When there is a conflict between the configuration settings in a site and in a profile, the site configuration wins.
Which content source and which codebase to use for a site are configuration settings, too. This enables the re-use of code and repoless sites.
Content Source
The content that makes up a site is pulled from a content source when authors preview or publish content. Typical sources include Microsoft Sharepoint and Google Drive, or the bring-your-own-markup adapter.
Create your first base site
The first step to creating a bunch of sites is to create a first site. This site can be used to serve content, but the most important job is to ensure that code is synchronized from your GitHub repository to all sites that use this codebase.
Pre-requisites
Github Repository : https://github.com/{org}/{site}
Content Repository (Gdrive / Sharepoint) : https://{org}.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/{site}
Create organization
Using the Admin API, we need to create the organization
Confirm the organization is created and you have administrator privileges.
Note : Please contact Adobe to obtain administrative privileges to create the organization config
Create site within organization
Using the Admin API, we create the first site
The new site is now available at https://main--{site}--{org}.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed yet.
Create a repoless site
Pre-requisites
Base site configured with code and content repository using the Admin API (see previous section)
Content Repository (Gdrive / Sharepoint) for new repoless site : https://{org}.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/{site2}
Create your first repoless site
Using the Admin API, we create new configuration for the first repoless site
The new site is now available at https://main--{site2}--{org}.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed.
Now we have created multiple sites sharing the same code base but different content repositories.
Additionally, you can use the Admin API to set other available advanced options to use within configuration management.
What’s not needed once you go repoless
When you start with Adobe Experience Manager, many settings are kept either with your content in the content source, or in the GitHub repository next to your code. With the Configuration Service there is now a central place for these kinds of settings.
Below gives you a comparison between how different areas are configured when we use the document mode (the traditional, distributed configuration) vs. using the Configuration Service API.

What is Adobe Experience Manager?
Create a website,
seriously fast.
Adobe Experience Manager now integrates the tech you already own, know, and love. Your content, your tech, your audience taken to the next level.
Use the technology you already have
No time for slow sites
Faster sites, better business
You don’t have the time for slow sites – and neither do your visitors.
Business OwnersSlow sites are not just a bad experience, they are also bad business. Why spend to acquire traffic only to lose the engagement on the site? Improved performance improves business outcomes like conversions, time on site, and order values.
VisitorsPerformance is the number one factor limiting user experience of sites on the web. Performance outranks all other factors including design and content. Slow sites means users bounce, leave, and never return.
SEOSlow sites mean most of your audience won’t even see your site. With site performance becoming the most important factor for search engine rankings, this means lost traffic that you need to buy back in ads.
DevelopersMany developers are stuck getting their sites to acceptable performance standards, and great performance seems out of reach. Adobe Experience Manager takes a performance-first approach to delivery, making lighthouse score 100 a reality.
Publish Faster
A CMS that gets out of the way gets your content on the way
Business OwnersBy using the tools your authors already know, you don’t just cut down on time for training and onboarding, you also manage your content in one place. When dealing with structured content, Adobe Experience Manager plays nice with Excel and Google Sheets.
AuthorsAEM takes the unstructured content that you already have, in Word or Google Docs, and turns it into active web experiences. You can use the tools you already know, and all it takes to publish is the press of a button.
DesignersThe content-first approach of AEM turns rigid content modeling chores on its head: the CMS adapts to the content authors create, instead of forcing authors to think in components, structure, and rules of a CMS.
Content OperationsBuilt with the needs of real-world mission-critical sites, AEM cracks the nuts of managing metadata at scale, delivering internationalized and localized content, optimizing for search engines, social sharing, testing, and experimentation.
Develop Faster
Everything modern web development needs, and not a single bit more
Business OwnersWith its lightweight approach to web development, Adobe Experience Manager allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days, and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
OperationsAEM is one less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software as a service and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
DevelopersAEM uses all the things modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, simplicity – and none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead.
Quality EngineersAutomated assurance of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices thanks to built-in quality checks. Continuous assurance of real-world site performance and functionality through real user monitoring.
Benefits
Made to meet your every CMS need and more
Unmatched Speed
The full Adobe Experience Manager stack is optimized for one thing: make your content shine, and make it fast. Delivering at speed is not enough, so we also make it fast to author, publish, and develop.
Content At Scale
From simple sites to ten thousands of pages, AEM handles content at scale, across markets, languages, and countries. And even the biggest sites publish instantly with pushed cache purges.
Uncertainty Eliminated
There’s no place for guesswork in authoring high-performing sites. Each preview generated by AEM offers 100% fidelity, and a unique, easily shareable URL for your reviewers.
Widen the Talent Pool
Using what you already know, is the core of the AEM approach. This means your team can do more with less, requires less training and creates fewer support tickets.
Low Code Productivity
Building great sites does not require complicated frameworks, tooling, or processes. AEM uses plain HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create exceptional experiences without the usual overhead.
Composability is Here
Headless or headful, your content can go farther with AEM’s composable architecture. Deliver the right content in the right format, and add the right decorations to make it an experience that stands out in any channel.
Content First
No matter if structured or unstructured, AEM puts your content first, delivers it optimally and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.
Peak Performance
Every great experience starts and ends with performance. Adobe continuously monitors the performance of your AEM site and lets you know when there are ways to improve. All you have to do is approve the pull request.

https://www.aem.live/developer/folder-mapping

Folder Mapping
It’s not uncommon for websites to serve multiple URLs from a single document, displaying dynamic content for large portions of the page without authors having to create each page individually.
Some scenarios where this is useful:
Commerce websites generating product pages from a product information API
Blogs with dynamic listing pages of posts for categories or tags
For a single-page application, mapping requests to a code-bus resource
AEM handles these cases via a folder mapping in the fstab.yaml file:
Additional Considerations
There are some additional rules applied to bulk metadata for folder mapped pages, see Folder-mapped metadata in the bulk metadata documentation for details.

https://www.aem.live/docs/authentication-setup-authoring

Configuring Authentication for Authors
Enable Authentication for Authors
By default, authors don’t need to be logged in in order to use Franklin via Sidekick. In order to enable authentication, it is sufficient to add relevant access-statements to your site configuration. Upon encountering said access-statements, the Sidekick will enforce authentication with the respective provider: Microsoft for Sharepoint based projects, and Google for Google Drive based projects.
Step 1: Create Configuration
If not present already, create your site configuration file:
In your site’s root folder create a folder named .helix
Go to the folder named .helix
Create a new spreadsheet with name:
On sharepoint: config.xlsx
On GDrive: config
On sharepoint: config.xlsx
On GDrive: config
Name the first column header key
Name the second column header value
Step 2: Add Access Allow To Configuration
Open your site configuration file, located in your site root folder: .helix/config.xslx (on Sharepoint) or .helix/config (on GDrive).
Add admin.role.author and or admin.role.publish key/value pairs as rows to your configuration sheet for each individual user or wildcard-domain you’d like to give access to the site for.
Example for an individual user: admin.role.publish = some.user@example.comExample for a wildcard domain: admin.role.author = *@example.com
The following example would grant author access all users within the “example.com” domain and publish rights to a the single user “some.user@example.com”:
Ensure that the users are able to authenticate themselves using their login credentials as follows:
If using Google Drive, they must be able to authenticate with their credentials using Google authentication.
If using Microsoft SharePoint, they must be able to authenticate with their credentials using Microsoft authentication.
Step 3: Activate Your Configuration
If you haven’t done so already, install the Sidekick Extension.
With the site configuration sheet still open, click the Sidekick’s “Preview Button”:
This will copy your site configuration to both the preview and live stages of Franklin, since configuration values are treated global.
Step 4: Login via Sidekick
The next time the Sidekick opens on a document, it will show a Sign In option:
Once you click it, it will open a new browser tab, redirecting to your respective provider:
The first time, it will ask for consent that the Franklin Admin service can access your sharepoint or google data. In case you are not admin on the account, you see a the following message:
In this case, ask an Active Directory admin of your organization to login via Sidekick or directly via the admin link: https://admin.hlx.page/auth/microsoft
They should see the following:
The admin can either grant consent directly by checking the ‘Consent on behalf of your organisation’ when they log in, or later via the Azure Portal.
Step 5: Granting Admin Consent via Azure Portal
In order to grant admin consent, open the azure portal and go to:Home -> Active Directory -> Enterprise Application s
Search for the Franklin Admin:
It should have the application id shown above.
Select the Permissions tab (below security):
And click on Grant admin consent for {your organisation}.
After clicking Accept you can refresh the Permissions blade a few times, until the consented permissions show up:
Now, the non admin user should be able to login:
Using the Admin Service (admin.hlx.page)
When authentication is enabled for admin.hlx.page using the API endpoint with tools like curl will require to use a proper auth token. For one time ad-hoc use by developers it is very convenient to just copy/paste the x-auth-token header from your browser's network tab from an authenticated request sent by sidekick to admin.hlx.page and pass it into the curl via the -H option. eg:
curl -v -H "x-auth-token: id_token=..." "https://admin.hlx.page/status/[org]/[repo]/main/?editUrl=auto"
Define user roles without enforcing authentication
By default, as soon as the role mapping is defined via an admin.role.* entry, authentication is enforced on that project. It might be desirable to allow unauthenticated access but still be able to define a user mapping, for example give a user the admin role.
The requireAuth property can be used for this with the following values:
auto is the default and enforces authentication as soon as a role mapping is defined.
true will always enforce authentication
false will not enforce authentication
Example:
Give the user bob@example.com the admin role but don’t enforce authentication:
Default Roles
If no role mapping is configured, the admin uses default roles to determine the permissions of the request. The default role can be specified using the admin.defaultRole property.
By default there are no default roles, unless requireAuth is auto, in this case the default role is basic_publish (see below). Example:
Use publish as default role:
Evaluation
The effective roles of a request are evaluated as follows:
If a request isn’t authenticated and requireAuth is true, a 401 status code is returned.
If a request isn’t authenticated and requiredAuth is auto and role mapping is defined, a 401 status code is returned.
If a request isn’t authenticated the defaultRole is used.
If a request is authenticated and no role mapping is defined, or if requireAuth is false, the defaultRole is used.
If a request is authenticated and role mapping is defined and requireAuth is not false, the roles that match the user are used.
If no mapping matches, the user will have no role; effectively always returning a 403 status code.
If several mapping matches, the user will have a combined set of roles
If no mapping matches, the user will have no role; effectively always returning a 403 status code.
If several mapping matches, the user will have a combined set of roles

Customizing the Sidekick
You can customize the sidekick for your project. You can add a /tools/sidekick/config.json configuration file to your project's GitHub repository:
For all available configuration options, see the Sidekick API documentation or the config schema. Here are some basics to get started:
Plugins
id and title are mandatory. title will show up on the plugin button. You can provide localized titles in a titleI18n object
How to specify the plugin action depends on the intent:
To simply open a URL in a new window, you can use the url property. You can optionally have it open in a palette by setting isPalette to true./tools/sidekick/config.json:
This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.
Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters
Show hidden characters
{
"plugins": [
{
"id": "foo",
"title": "Foo",
"url": "/tools/sidekick/foo.html"
},
]
}
view raw
config-plugin-url.json
hosted with ❤ by GitHub
Executing code must be done in the context of your page (not supported in the edit and admin environment). You can use the event property to specify the name of an event to be fired when the plugin button gets clicked. You can then react to it in your application code as in the following example:/tools/sidekick/config.json:https://gist.github.com/rofe/e5f215be84acc51ffe87002408d4e107 /scripts/scripts.js:https://gist.github.com/rofe/4d38d9ec8253cc2f4bec3dad757c33fc

The environments array specifies where the plugin should appear (dev, edit, admin, preview, live, or prod). You can also define exclude_paths and include_paths arrays to narrow down the plugin’s appearance based on the path.
isContainer turns a plugin into a dropdown. You can then add other plugins to it by specifying its ID in the containerId property.
override can be set to true to extend an existing plugin.
Special Views
path and viewer are mandatory. Optionally, you can specify a title that will be shown at the top, and you can provide localized titles in a titleI18n object:https://gist.github.com/rofe/9170d068a7b3ab727a8745774e430aca
Add an HTML file as configured in path to your project’s GitHub repository:https://gist.github.com/rofe/0de48b1696c7334f6fdbd9f63993aad2
Add an optional CSS file in the same directory, and a JS file with your logic:https://gist.github.com/rofe/8357f72407683cf4bd27c5d364b71af7
Open a project URL that matches the configured path and click the sidekick to see your viewer in action.

Custom domains without a custom CDN
The most common way of going live with a AEM site is to use a custom Content Delivery Network (CDN). Our documentation provides instructions for the most common CDN providers and through your Slack support channel, the AEM team provides assistance.
If you do not have a CDN, we can provide you with assistance in setting up a custom domain without a CDN.
Prerequisites and limitations
You must own the domain under which you want to serve your site
You need to be able to make Domain Name System (DNS) changes to the domain name
Adobe will provide you with a TLS certificate, and you do not have a choice in certificate authority to use
You will be able to establish a redirect from https://example.com to https://www.example.com but all other redirects must happen through the redirects spreadsheet
HTTPS is required and IPv6 is not supported
Before you go live
Reach out to the Adobe team in your dedicated Slack channel and tell them which domain (e.g. www.example.com) you want to use and which site (e.g. https://main–example–hlxsites.hlx.live) should be the content source.
The Adobe team will verify the request and tell you when you are ready for the next step. This will usually take a few hours and might take up to one business day.
Setup push invalidation
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the managed CDN whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
After making changes to the config sheet, preview it with the sidekick to activate the changes.
Authorize the creation of the domain validation (DV) Certificate through ACME Challenge
This ensures that the domain validation certificate is available before any traffic is directed to the CDN.
Create a CNAME as below (aka ACME DNS challenge ) to authorize the creation of the DV Certificate
_acme-challenge.<your-domain-name> CNAME <challenge-value>
For e.g.
_acme-challenge.example.com CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com
The “challenge value” would be provided to you by the AEM team.
Once the above is done, execute dig command as below
$ dig _acme-challenge.example.com
And ensure that it responds with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
If you got the response as above, you can skip the “Special Note“ below.
Note: Once the DV Certificate challenge has been created, customers have 7 days to create the validation CNAME. If not done within 7 days, then the Adobe team needs to retry the certificate issue process after the validation CNAME is created.
Special Note for DNS providers that require a trailing period (.)
Some but not all DNS providers require that a period (.) is added to the end of a target DNS to indicate that it is not local to the DNS Zone where the CNAME is being added.
dig and nslookup also add a . to the end of a domain reported to show it is fully qualified and not in the context of the zone being queried.
For instance, if we say we need a CNAME like the one below, we are using Full FQDNS (as you would see in a http url)
_acme-challenge.example.com CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com
We expect it to be added so that
$dig _acme-challenge.example.com
responds with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
And not…
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.example.com.
(here the record was added to the DNS provider with no trailing period (.) after example-acme-server.com and hence the DNS provider assumed the target was local to the zone, i.e. example.com.... which makes no sense for an ACME DNS challenge)
To handle such situations, where your DNS provider requires you to add a trailing period (.), create a CNAME record as below:
_acme-challenge.example.com. CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
Observe the trailing period (.) in the example above.
Retry the dig command as follows
$dig _acme-challenge.example.com
And ensure that now it responds as expected with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
Optionally lowering TTL of existing DNS records in preparation of going live for faster roll-out
If your existing DNS records for the domain which is set to go live, have a long TTL (like 12 hours or more), then for faster roll-out of the site once it is live, you may want to set it to a lower TTL (like 1 hour or maybe even as low as 60 seconds). This ensures that after going live, the traffic starts getting routed to the new site faster instead of waiting for the original TTL to expire. Do remember to restore the TTL back to the original value while updating the DNS records for going live.
As you go live
Make or request following DNS change:
For www.example.com set the CNAME DNS record to hlxcdn.adobeaemcloud.com
Use a high time to live (TTL) of 3600 seconds (one hour) or more. This will increase the reliability of site delivery in case of a DNS outage. If you lowered the TTL value for faster roll-out in preparation of going live, restore it to its original longer value.
If you want to establish an automatic redirect from from https://example.com to https://www.example.com the following additional steps are required
For example.com set the A record to these four IP addresses: 151.101.2.117, 151.101.66.117, 151.101.130.117, and 151.101.194.117
If your DNS provider cannot support multiple IP addresses in an A record (e.g. GoDaddy), use any of the listed IP addresses. This will be a bit less reliable, but won’t matter
Use the same high TTL as described above
Depending on your existing DNS setup including the TTL specified in the DNS records, these changes can take a few minutes to several hours to complete. If you have existing traffic on the site, make sure all redirects are in place or keep your existing site functional till the traffic has completely been redirected to the new site, which is essentially waiting out for the duration of the TTL in the DNS records to expire.
The certificates are issued automatically after you have successfully set up the ACME challenge as explained in the “Authorize the creation of the DV Certificate through ACME Challenge” section above.
Please note that if you are hosting both APEX and the `www` domains they both need to have the DNS configured for the certificate to be generated.
If you are looking for a timed launch, it is a good idea to create a temporary holding home page that will be replaced with the correct content at the desired launch time. As publishing in AEM is fast and predictable, this will give you more control over the visibility of your content than relying on DNS.
After you go live
The AEM team will verify your setup and let you know if any problems arise.

Upgrading to aem.live from hlx.live
If you are familiar with *.hlx.live for published content and *.hlx.page for previews, please note that we are introducing *.aem.live and *.aem.page as new domains for your sites.
With this change, we are also introducing several improvements while making sure everything works just as before. The most important benefit is that preview URLs will load faster on aem.page thanks to caching.
In this guide, we will walk you through the changes you'll need to make to upgrade to aem.live. Many of these steps are only required if you use specific features, so you may not need to complete all steps. Rest assured, the process is straightforward, and we are here to help you every step of the way.
Try your site on aem.live
Go to your site on hlx.live and replace hlx.live in the URL with aem.live. For instance, if you used to see your site on https://main--helix-website--adobe.hlx.live/ then your new URL would be https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.live/. No more hlx.live, instead it's aem.live now.
Try previews on aem.page
If your site works on aem.live, then previews will also work on aem.page. For instance, if you used to see your site on https://main--helix-website--adobe.hlx.page/ then your new URL would be https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.page/.
Tell Sidekick to use aem.live and aem.page
Even though both hlx.page and aem.page work for previews now, Sidekick will always default to hlx.page.
Let's change this. In your Sharepoint or Google Drive folder, locate the .helix/config spreadsheet and add following values:
cdn.live.host: main--{ repo }--{ owner }.aem.live
cdn.preview.host: main--{ repo }--{ owner }.aem.page
Preview the spreadsheet using Sidekick to activate the new configuration.After activating the configuration, please make sure the Sidekick preview action is opening urls with .aem.page.
Point your CDN to aem.live
In your CDN setup, change the origin URL or host name from hlx.live to aem.live and activate the change. If you experience any issues, then revert the origin URL or host name back to hlx.live and contact Adobe for assistance.
We recommend to make the change in lower environment such as stage before performing it in production environment
That's it, you made it! Your site is now on aem.live. For 95% of all sites, this is all you have to do. Keep reading for the remaining 5% of special cases.
If you need help during the upgrade or ran into issues, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us to discuss further.
Advanced Upgrade Scenarios
If you are using BYO DNS without BYO CDN
If you use custom domains without a custom CDN, please contact Adobe to perform the origin change to aem.live.
If you are using hlx.page or hlx.live urls in your code
Check your GitHub repository for any references to hlx.page or hlx.live. If you find them, double-check the functionality, as the changed hostname may introduce CORS or other cross-origin issues. Update the references to aem.page or aem.live.
Code references to hlx.page and hlx.live in the sampleRUM() function, lib-franklin.js or aem.js do not need to be changed.
If you are using hlx.page or hlx.live in your content
Check your content repository for any instances where you might have references for hlx.page or hlx.live in any content areas, including spreadsheets, for project-specific functionality.
Update link references around project documentation areas that may include, but not limited to, Block Library, Runbooks, Authoring Guides, and Pull Request Templates.
We don't need to update in-content or absolute links/hrefs pointing to hlx.page or hlx.live in the Word documents, as they will be auto-transformed to aem.page and aem.live.
If you use the deprecated forms endpoint to receive form posts in Excel or Google Sheets
The forms service on hlx.live has been deprecated and will not be supported on aem.live. Please contact Adobe to discuss possible alternatives for this service.
If you have configured external services to use hlx.page or hlx.live
Many services like Google reCaptcha, Google Maps, Cloudflare Turnstile, etc. use the site domain or referrer domain to validate API tokens. If you have configured these services to allow your site on hlx.page or hlx.live, make sure to also allow aem.page and aem.live
If you want to update aem.js, too
Upgrading to aem.live does not require code changes. Some teams use the opportunity to also update to the latest version of aem.js. It's best to treat this as a separate upgrade and (like all code changes) test it on a separate branch.

(Deprecated) Preparing a Sheet for Data Ingestion
AEM offers a forms service that ingests submitted data into a Microsoft Excel or Google Sheet document.
Having data submitted through forms on your website flow directly into spreadsheets makes it easily accessible to business users. Such data can also interact with more complex automated workflows as both Google Sheets as well as Microsoft Excel and Sharepoint offer access to a vibrant ecosystem and robust APIs.
Create an Excel workbook or Google sheet anywhere under your project directory. This document uses a sheet in OneDrive called email-form.xlsx in the root of an AEM project.
Make sure the AEM user (for example helix@adobe.com) that is configured for your project has edit permission on the sheet.
Open the workbook created and rename the default sheet to incoming.
Note: AEM will not send any data to this workbook if the incoming sheet does not exist.
Preview the sheet in the sidekick. 
Note: Even if a sheet has been previewed previously it must be previewed again after creating the incoming sheet for the first time.
Set up the sheet with the headers that match the data being ingested. You can either do this manually or by sending a POST request to the form route in the AEM Admin service. The admin service will look at the data in the POST body and create the necessary headers/tables and sheets required to ingest data and get the most from the forms service.For details on the format of the POST request to set up your sheet, see the Admin API documentation as well as the following example:Request:
POST /form/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/en/email-form.json HTTP/1.1
{"data":{"firstName":"test"}}
Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{"rowCount":2,"columns":["firstName"]}
You can use a tool like curl or Postman to make this POST request. For example:
curl -s -i -X POST 'https://admin.hlx.page/form/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/en/email-form.json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"data":{"firstName":"test"}}'
Through the above POST request, we are providing sample data i.e. the form fields and sample values which will be used by the Admin service for setting up the form.The Admin service is recommended to set up your sheet, but if you would like to create the headers manually, please see the document Manual Forms Sheet Setup.
After sending the POST request to the admin service you will see the following changes to your workbook.
A sheet named helix-default is created. The data in this sheet is what will be returned when a GET request is made to the sheet. This is a great place to use spreadsheet formulas to summarize the data from the incoming sheet for consumption elsewhere.Note: The helix-default sheet should never contain any personally identifiable information or other data you are not ok with being publicly accessible.
A sheet named slack was created. Here you can set up automatic notifications to a Slack channel anytime data is ingested to your spreadsheet. Currently AEM only supports notifications to the AEM Engineering slack org as well as the Adobe Enterprise Support org.
To setup Slack notifications enter the teamId of the Slack workspace and the channel name or ID. You can also ask the slack-bot (with the debug command) for the teamId and the channel ID. Using the channel ID instead of the name is preferable, as it survives channel renames.Note: Older forms didn’t have the teamId column. The teamId was included in the channel column, separated by a # or /.
Enter any title you want and under fields enter the names of the fields you want to see in the Slack notification. Each heading should be separated by a comma (eg. name, email).

(Deprecated) Sending Data to Your Sheet
The sheet is now ready for data ingestion and you can send POST requests directly to the sheet on hlx.page, hlx.live or your production domain.
Note: The URL should not include the .json extension. The sheet must be published for POST operations to work on .live or on the production domain.
There are a few different ways you can format the form data in the POST body.
As an array of name/value pairshttps://gist.github.com/dylandepass/9ba6b83700dfce1fa90a47bde62c2e9
As an object with key/value pairshttps://gist.github.com/dylandepass/2b5f694723dfdb3d304fcafc613d6595
As x-www-form-urlencoded body (content-type header must be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded)https://gist.github.com/dylandepass/b72b2e30313bc80beb02e12b1d7201ff
That’s it! The forms service runs every minute so you will quickly see your data ingested into the sheet.
Author-Created Forms
In many cases it is desirable to have authors create forms and decide what form fields should be presented to the visitor of your website. It is common to use the helix-default sheet of the same spreadsheet that is used for the submission of the form as the place to let the author define their forms.
Usually, there is a forms block that takes a reference to the spreadsheet and renders the form and handles the user flow through submission.
A simple example of such a basic form block can be found here. You can also use the Adaptive Forms Block to develop forms.
See the following example of what the spreadsheet for the form definition could look like.
The supported form fields are extensible and the form should be viewed as an example that gives you a starting point.
As an example a fully-functional form was added to this page, using the previously-listed code base by simply adding the following block in the Google Doc:
Feel free to try it out and see the form data flow into the incoming sheet. It may take a minute to get from the form service to the spreadsheet.

https://www.aem.live/developer/anatomy-of-a-helix-project

The Anatomy of a Project
This document describes what a typical project should look like from a code standpoint. Before reading this document, please familiarize yourself with the document Getting Started - Developer Tutorial.
Git and GitHub
One of our defining philosophies is that it is easiest to allow users to work with the tools that they are familiar with. The overwhelming majority of developers manage their code in systems based on Git, so it only makes sense to allow developers to work with Git to manage and deploy their code.
We are using a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repo. After installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repo, websites are automatically created for each of your branches for content preview on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/ and the production site on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.live/ for published content.
Every resource that you put into your GitHub repo is available on your website, so a file in your GitHub repo on the main branch in /scripts/scripts.js will be available on https://main--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/scripts/scripts.jsThis should be very intuitive. There are few “special” files that Adobe Experience Manager uses to connect the content into your website.
We strongly recommend that repos are kept public on GitHub, to foster the community. For a public facing website there really is no need to keep the code hidden, as it is being served to the browsers of your website.
Important notes:
The combination <branch>--<repo>--<owner> must not exceed 63 characters (including the hyphens/dashes). This is a subdomain name constraint.
branch, repo and owner cannot contain --.
Configuration Files
There are some files in your GitHub repo that have a special meaning to AEM and are processed in a special fashion. These files are in the root directory of your repo.
The Content Connection: fstab.yaml
As you may have seen in the getting started guide the fstab.yaml file serves as the connection to your Google Drive or SharePoint folders that contain your content. This file is used as an indicator for how the code in your GitHub repo gets combined with the content in your content source.
Beyond providing the connection to the content, the fstab.yaml also provides a folder mapping facility that allows you map extensionless “routes” to a given piece of content or static HTML.
The Entry Point: head.html
The head.html file is the most important extension point to influence the markup of the content. The easiest way to think of it is that this file is injected on the server side as part of the <head> HTML tag and is combined with the metadata coming from the content.
The head.html should remain largely unchanged from the boilerplate and there are only very few legitimate reasons in a regular project to make changes. Those include remapping your project to a different base URL for the purposes of exposing your project in a different folder than the root folder of your domain on your CDN or to support legacy browsers which usually require scripts that are not loaded as modules.
Adding marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts to your head.html file is strongly advised against due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to head.html is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons, see the section Scripts and Styles below for more information about handling scripts and styles.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/business-website/blob/main/head.html
Not Found: 404.html
To create a custom 404 response, place a 404.html file into the root of your github repository. This will be served on any URL that doesn’t map to an existing resource in either content or code, and replaces the body of the out of the box minimalist 404 response.
The 404 can mimic the markup of an existing page including your code for the site, with navigation footers etc., or it can have a completely different appearance.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/hlxsites/bamboohr-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/404.html See in Action
Don’t Serve: .hlxignore
There are some files in your repo that should not be served from your website, either because you would like to keep them private or they are not relevant to the delivery of the website (e.g. tests, build tools, build artifacts, etc.) and don’t need to be observed by the AEM bot. You can add those to a .hlxignore file in the same format as the well-known .gitignore file.
Please see the following example.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.hlxignore
Tame the Bots: robots.txt
A robots.txt file is generally a regular file that is served as you would expect on your production website on your own domain. To protect your preview and origin site from being indexed, your .page and .live sites will serve a robots.txt file that disallows all robots instead of the robots.txt file from your repo.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/robots.txt
Query and Indexing: helix-query.yaml
There is a flexible indexing facility that lets you keep track of all of your content pages conveniently as a spreadsheet. This facility is often used to show lists or feeds of pages as well as to filter and sort content on a website. Please see the document Indexing for more information.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
Automate Your Sitemap: helix-sitemap.yaml
Complex sitemaps can automatically be created for you whenever authors publish new content, including flexible hreflang mappings where needed. This functionality is usually based on the indexing facility.See this GitHub issue for sitemap configuration options.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/fedpub/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
Commonly Used File and Folder Structure
Beyond the files treats as special or configuration files, there is a commonly-used structure that is expressed in the Boilerplate repo.
The common folders below are usually in the root directory of a project repo, but in cases where only a portion of a website is handled by AEM, they are often moved to a subfolder to reflect the mapping of the route of the origin in a CDN.
This means that in a case where for example only /en/blog/ is initially mapped to AEM from the CDN, all the folder structures below (eg. /scripts, /styles, /blocks etc.) are moved into a the /en/blog/ folder in GitHub to keep the CDN mapping as simple as possible.
With a simple adjustment of the reference to scripts.js and styles.css in head.html (see above) it is possible to indicate that all the necessary files are loaded from the respective code base directory. To avoid url rewriting the folder structure is also created the content source (eg. sharepoint or google drive) by having a directory structure of /en/blog/.In many cases as the AEM footprint grows on a site there is a point in time when the code gets moved back to the root folder and the head.html references are adjusted accordingly.
Scripts and Styles
By convention in a AEM project, the head.html references styles.css, scripts.js, and lib-aem.js located in /scripts and /styles, as the entry points for the project code.
scripts.js is where your global custom javascript code lives and is where the block loading code is triggered. styles.css hosts the global styling information for your site, and minimally contains the global layout information that is needed to display the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).As all three files are loaded before the page can be displayed, it is important that they are kept relatively small and executed efficiently.Beyond styles.css, a lazy-styles.css file is commonly used, which is loaded after the LCP event, and therefore can contain slower/more CSS information. This could be a good place for fonts or global CSS that is below the fold.
In addition to scripts.js, there is the commonly-used delayed.js. This is a catch-all for libraries that need to be loaded on a page but should be kept from interfering with the delivery of the page. This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.
Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.
The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Icons
Most projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

BYO CDN Setup for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
Customers may use their own CDN to deliver AEM content under their own domain (aka BYO Production CDN). While customers are generally free to configure their CDN according to their own needs there are some settings mandated/recommended by Adobe Experience Manager:
Origin urlhttps://main--<yoursite>--<yourorg>.hlx.live
Headers sent to origin
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(optional, see Configuring Push Invalidation)
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(optional, see Configuring Push Invalidation)
Origin cache controlI.e. Cache TTL on the production CDN is controlled via origin cache control response headers. This should be enabled (if available).
Compression (gzip)Should be enabled
Query parameters
Must be forwarded to origin
Must be included in cache key
Must be forwarded to origin
Must be included in cache key
Age response headerThe Age response header must be either suppressed or overridden (Age: 0)

Cloudflare Setup (worker) for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Cloudflare to deliver content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
This setup can be completely done in the browser by using the Cloudflare Dashboard only. If you are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler & GitHub and not afraid of entering commands in a terminal window you might want to follow the instructions here instead.
Create a Cloudflare site
If you already have a cloudflare site and DNS setup you can skip forward to the Setup push invalidation section.
Enter the domain:
Select a plan:
Note that surgical push invalidations are only supported on the Enterprise plan. On all other plans the entire cache of the site will be purged every time an author publishes a content change.For this walk-through we’ll use the Free plan.
Setup push invalidation
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
values: free, pro, business, enterprise
default: free
only enterprise plan supports purge-by-tag
To create an API Token,
go to API Tokens
click on "Create Token",
go to "Create Custom Token" at the bottom and click on "Get started"
enter a token name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
Permissions: "Zone", "Cache Purge", "Purge"
Zone Resources: "Include", "Specific zone", "<your production zone>"
click on "Continue to summary"
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value.
Note that only sites on the enterprise plan will be surgically purged by url and cache key. A Purge All will be performed instead on non-enterprise sites every time an author publishes a content change.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
For a new site, we’ll start with a simple DNS setup.
Create a new CNAME record. If your zone is example.com and you want to serve traffic on www.example.com, then the name should be www
If you want to serve traffic on example.com (without a www) then the name should be @
And if you want to serve traffic on all subdomains, then the name should be * as in the screenshot below
As we are using workers to serve the content, the value of the Content field does not matter. It’s easiest to use your ref--repo--owner.hlx.live host name here. This is a hostname, not a URL, so leave out the leading https://
Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied:
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list:
On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable it:
Configure Caching
Create Cache Rules
Note: Enable Origin Cache Control option is only available for enterprise accounts. Free, Pro, and Business customers have this option enabled by default and cannot disable it.
Create Worker
Choose Workers in the left pane and click on “Manage Workers”:
Click on “Create a Service”:
Enter a name for the worker (e.g. “helix-worker”) and click on “Create Service”:
Click on “Quick edit”:
Edit worker code
If you have successfully configured push invalidation copy the content of this file, otherwise copy the content of this file.
In the left pane, replace the existing content with the copied content.
Click on “Save and Deploy”:
Click on Settings and “Add variable”:
Add a variable ORIGIN_HOSTNAME and set the value to the hostname of your origin (e.g. main--mysite--hlxsites.hlx.live):
Click on Triggers an select “Add route”:
Enter your domain route (e.g. www.mydomain.com/*), select your zone and click on “Add route”:
Depending on the setup chosen in DNS Setup, you would select routes www.mydomain.com/*, mydomain.com/*, or *.mydomain.com/*After completing all steps you should be all set.
Expanding the AEM footprint on your website
In case you start with having only a portion of the website being routed to your .live origin and have routed a specific folder (eg. /blog/*) you can subsequently add more routes whenever you are ready to expose new sections of the site by simply adding more routes and repeat the last “add route” steps as needed, without changing your worker configuration.
Watch out for duplicate content
Search engines often penalize sites for duplicate content, so it's important to make sure your content is not available on the web elsewhere. Cloudflare, unfortunately, has a default setting that will expose your site on additional network ports. In paid Cloudflare plans you can block traffic on these additional ports. This is a recommended setting for production sites.

Akamai Setup for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
The following screenshots illustrate how to use the Akamai Property Manager to configure a property to deliver content from AEM using your Akamai CDN setup. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Essential Property settings
Origin Server
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: Remove Vary Header
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: Modify Outgoing Request Header
Configuration properties:
Add more outgoing request headers:
Configuration properties:
Configuration properties:
Add/Modify Behavior: Caching
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: HTTP/2
(Optional, but recommended)
Add Rule: Modify Outgoing Response Header
Create a new rule
Set the criteria for the rule to be applied
Set the behavior if a match is found
These are all essential property settings for delivering content.
Caveats
Do not enable Akamai mPulse Real Usage Monitoring. While the performance impact on most sites is negligible, for sites built for consistent high performance, enabling it will prevent reaching a Lighthouse Score of 100. In AEM, you have a Real User Monitoring service built-in, so that dual instrumentation will be unnecessary and is strongly discouraged.
Also, do not enable Akamai Bot Manager or similar Web Application Firewall offerings, as they markedly interfere with rendering performance and user experience. Your site on AEM is protected against bot attacks on the backend, so that this performance cost comes with negligible benefit.
Setup push invalidation
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
AEM push invalidation uses the Akamai Fast Purge API, specifically Delete by URL and Delete by cache tag.

Real Use Monitoring (RUM)
Adobe Experience Manager uses Real Use Monitoring (RUM) to instrument operations data to understand checkpoints on how a site functions and performs on Adobe Experience Manager-powered sites. RUM data can be used to diagnose performance issues, and to measure the effectiveness of experiments. RUM preserves the privacy of visitors through sampling (only a small portion of all page views will be monitored) and judicious exclusion of all personally identifiable information (PII).
RUM and Privacy
Real Use Monitoring in Adobe Experience Manager is designed to preserve visitor privacy and minimize data collection. As a visitor, this means that no personal information will be collected by the site you are visiting or made available to Adobe. As a site operator, this means no opt-in is required to enable this feature.AEM RUM does not use any client-side state or ID, such as cookies or localStorage, sessionStorage or similar, to collect usage metrics. There is no “fingerprinting” of devices or individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of capturing sampled data.
It is not permitted to add any personal data into the RUM data collection.
RUM data is sampled
Traditional web analytics solutions try to collect every single visitor. Adobe Experience Manager’s Real Use Monitoring only captures information from a small fraction of activities tied to page views, with no concept of identifying a visitor or a user or even a browser session. Under normal circumstances the sampling rate is one out of one hundred page views , although site operators can decide to increase or decrease this number.
As the decision if data will be collected is made on a page view by page view basis, it cannot be used to track interactions across multiple pages. RUM has no concept of visits, visitors, or sessions, only checkpoints during a page view. This is by design.
What data is being collected
RUM is designed to prevent the collection of personally identifiable information. The full set of information that can be collected by Adobe Experience Manager’s Real Use Monitoring is:
The host name of the site being visited, such as www.aem.live
The host name of the server responsible for the data collection such as rum.hlx.live
The user agent (technical name of the browser) that is used to display the page such as Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_4_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0.3 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1. This string is then simplified to desktop, desktop:windows, desktop:mac, desktop:linux, mobile, mobile:android, mobile:ios, mobile:ipados, or bot so that only the device class is stored.
The time of the data collection such as 2021-06-26 06:00:02.596000 UTC (in order to preserve privacy, we round all minutes to the previous hour, so that only seconds and milliseconds are tracked)
The URL of the page being visited, such as https://www.aem.live/docs/rum if the URL contains URL parameters, these parameters will not be collected or stored
The Referrer URL (the URL of the page that linked to the current page) such as https://www.aem.live/docs
A randomly generated ID of the page view such as 2Ac6
The weight or inverse of the sampling rate such as 100 (this means only one in one hundred page views will be recorded)
The checkpoint, or name of a particular event in the sequence of loading the page or interacting with it as a visitor such as viewmedia (this particular checkpoint is fired when an image becomes at least 25% visible in the browser)
The source, or identifier of the DOM element that the received the interaction event with for the checkpoint mentioned above such as .images
The target, or link to an external page or resource that received and interaction with for the checkpoint mentioned above such as https://blog.adobe.com/jp/publish/2022/06/29/media_162fb947c7219d0537cce36adf22315d64fb86e94.png
The Core Web Vitals (CWV) performance metrics Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), Interaction to Next Paint (INP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) that describe the visitor’s quality of experience.
The foundational performance metric Time to First Byte (TTFB) that describes the visitors's quality of experience
No other data is being collected.
What data is being stored in the visitor's browser
For sites that use the built-in experimentation feature, the name of the experiment and variants that the visitor has seen are also stored in the browser's session storage.
How RUM data is being used
Adobe uses RUM data for following purposes:
To identify and fix performance bottlenecks on customer sites
To estimate the number of page views to customer sites
To understand how Adobe Experience Manager interacts with other scripts (such as analytics, targeting, or external libraries) on the same page to increase compatibility
Data Overview
The data collected and stored is designed to prevent:
Identification of individual visitors or devices
Fingerprinting
Tracking of visits or sessions
Enrichment or combination with personal identifiable information from other sources
Other than Adobe, following third parties are involved in the collection of RUM data:
Fastly, Inc
Cloudflare, Inc
Coralogix LTD
Google LLC
Amazon.com, Inc
RUM for Developers
We have additional in-depth information for developers that want to use Adobe’s RUM data to optimize their own sites, including instructions on how to add RUM instrumentation to your site, even if it's not running on AEM.

Developing Real Use Monitoring in AEM
Adobe Experience Manager uses Real Use Monitoring (RUM) to diagnose usage and performance of web sites running on Adobe Experience Manager. As a developer, you can use the RUM APIs to observe additional events about how your site is used.
This document describes the key concepts of Real Use Monitoring, details the client-side APIs that you can use to send additional data to the RUM collection service and alludes to the fact that the data can be queried.
How to add RUM Instrumentation to your Site
If your website is not built.using AEM Edge Delivery Services, it is recommended to set up Real Use Monitoring in standalone mode. To set up , simply add the following script to your pages.
<script defer type="text/javascript" src="https://rum.hlx.page/.rum/@adobe/helix-rum-js@^2/dist/rum-standalone.js"></script>
For better performance, it is recommended loading the script after the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) event
Key Concepts
Every data point collected by RUM is made up of following key parts:
id – a unique identifier, generated by the RUM library that identifies the current page view
checkpoint – a named event in the sequence of loading the page, and interacting with the page
source – identifies the DOM element that caused a particular interaction (optional)
target – identifies an external resource or link that is the subject of an interaction (optional)
Checkpoints
As a developer, you can define your own checkpoints. By convention, checkpoint names are lowercase letters, without any special characters. The most common checkpoints used in Adobe Experience Manager projects are:
top – the page loading sequence has begun and first JavaScript code is being executed by the page. This event fires even before blocks are decorated or content is visible
load – corresponds to the Window: load event in JavaScript and is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.
cwv – indicates that either the page is ready to collect Core Web Vitals (CWV) readings or that either the LCP, CLS, or FID CWV reading has been recorded. As these readings are asynchronous, multiple of these checkpoints can be passed during one page view
lazy – the page is ready for lazy loading of non-essential resources as part of the Lazy stage of the ELD cycle.
lcp – the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) has been made by the browser, this is usually the most prominent image on the page
viewblock – a block has scrolled into view and there is a chance that the content of that block is seen. The class name of the block will be shared in the source property.
viewmedia – an image or video has scrolled into view and there is a chance that the content of that block is seen. The URL of the image or video is shared in the target property.
click – a click event has been triggered, not just on links or buttons. If the element clicked is a link, then the link target is recorded in the target property. The source property contains information about which element of the DOM was clicked.
experiment – an experiment (challenger or control) has been presented, which can be an A/B test or targeted content.
error – a JavaScript error has occurred on the page and has not been handled by the application code. This usually indicates a bug.
404 – a 404, page not found page has been served. This checkpoint can indicate missing content or broken links
unsupported – the page has been opened by a browser that does not support the more advanced RUM collection features. This checkpoint is fired by less than a tenth of a percent of all page views. There is also the related noscript checkpoint for browsers that do not have JavaScript enabled, which is even less common.
search – a site search on the page is performed, typically using a search input field
formsubmit – a form is submitted on the page. The form action is recorded in the target property, while the source property keeps information of which form of the page was submitted.
leave – corresponds to the Window: pagehide event or to Document: visibilitychange event (whichever happens first) if the new document.visibilityState is hidden. This checkpoint is triggered when the page is not visible anymore, e.g. when the browser is closed, or when switched to a different tab in the browser.

David’s Model, Second take.
By: David Nuescheler
Historical Context
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I got to a point where I realized that people had a lot of different options on how they could model content in a content repository specification that I was involved in.
So in 2007 I started writing up my controversial opinions around content modeling in JCR and to make sure that people considered it “just my opinion” and nothing that would claim universal applicability I called it “David’s Model”.
It seems that this has helped people in the context of modeling content on an infrastructure level.
Today, I find myself very often in situations that feel the same when arguing “How to model or structure content in Adobe Experience Manager”.
The parameters and stakeholders feel very different today, as I am not primarily worried about the underlying infrastructure anymore but about the user experience of a person authoring content and reaching a great authoring experience across different content sources and to a lesser extent the ease of developing against those structures and being able have portable (block) code across projects and content sources.
Introduction
This document should serve as a collection of “Content Modeling” or “Content Structure” best practices as they relate to Adobe Experience Manager and more importantly to an intuitive authoring experience across different authoring platforms. A good way of testing a content model, is to imagine an author working in different environments (eg. Word, Google Docs, AEM, Custom Authoring etc.) and making sure that the content model can easily be constructed in an intuitive manner across all possible content sources.
These “rules” are a reflection of lessons learned from first-hand authoring and authoring support and are rooted in the experiences working on real-world limitations of commonly used authoring environments like Microsoft Word Online or Google Docs, but also in the average knowledge of said tooling by the average author.
Making the authoring experience intuitive, simple and fast is paramount for the long-term success of any project as lays the foundation of authors enjoying making updates to websites or other digital experiences.
These rules are evolving, and I would like to invite discussion and commentary on all of them.
Rule #1: Blocks are not great for authoring
Generally blocks are not great as they are surfaced as tables on the authoring side. They provide a necessary framework for an author to indicate some special functionality or design for a certain component. For authors it is often easier to work in “Default Content” wherever possible.For developers blocks are a great way to componentize their work, so there is tension where the developer feels that having something in a block makes their lives easier, sacrificing authoring ease-of-use.
A good way to get the best of both worlds is to add Auto Blocking, which means that you infer the existence of a Block based on sequence, template or link information. A good example of this is the hero block in boilerplate which creates a hero block, based on the fact there is an image before the h1 of a page.
It is definitely an anti-pattern to have things that are represented natively as default content and put them into a block, so something like a Text, Heading or Image block yields a bad authoring perspective.
Rule #2: No nested blocks for authors
To a developer it might very often be tempting to nest complex structures, which in word document would lead to a table inside a table. As Rule #1 states that blocks are not desirable, nested blocks are definitely a lot worse.
Consider fragments (referencing other documents) or links (with auto blocking) to reduce the authoring complexity.
Rule #3: Limit Row and Column spans
Generally we use a Column Span (merged cells) to denote the header with a block name in it. This is relatively straightforward and works well in word and google docs.There are definitely situations where more complex table structure make sense (eg. a portion of the block content being in two columns and another portion of the block content being in three columns) but it is important to understand that creating and managing these structures can be extremely difficult, especially in word online that has very enigmatic support for complex tables.
If you find yourself in a place where you have a non-trivial rows and columns setup with spans / merged cells, it is probably a good idea to consider a different structure.
Rule #4: Fully qualified URLs only
When referencing content sometimes developers think in references that are relative to host, the content repository or to their sharepoint / google drive. Authors (and most humans) often think of a URL as an opaque token that they copy/paste from their browser without deciphering them into protocol, hostname, pathname, etc.It is always advisable to just let authors work fully qualified URLs and let either AEM or a developer do the work of extracting eg. a pathname where needed. As a bonus the URL can and should link to something that is easily accessible for an author from their document.
Rule #5: Lists?
I often find myself in a situation where a block has a list of references, something like a list of related articles, or a list of cards. In HTML a lot of those semantically should be considered lists (mostly <ul><il> combinations). For simple lists, something like some text (possibly with a link) or just regular links, a list in word or google docs may be ideal.
It turns out that list items that are more complex, are somewhere between “hard” to “practically impossible” for an author to keep that in a list in word or google drive.In that case it is much easier to have the list items be rows of a block table. A good example of that is cards block in the boilerplate project.
For simple lists where it is intuitive to have inferred semantics, eg. a related articles block in a blog post that just contains links to the articles that should be references, it may be easiest to just have a single table cell inside the block containing all the links and dropping the actual list in the word processor. From a code standpoint it is usually easy to just pull all the links from a block and not specifically worry about the details of a structure in that particular block.
Rule #6: Buttons need to inherit from context
In many design guides we find buttons as a common element across many blocks and default content. In many cases they are outlined in all their variations (eg. primary vs. secondary, sizes, colors, etc.) at the beginning of a design specification together with the specified colors and fonts.
In projects we found that it is intuitive for authors to treat links that are on a line by themselves as for a button. In many cases it is important to inherit from the block and section context that a particular button is in to make the authoring experience easy.
As an example, if a button (read, “link by itself on a line”) is a part of a hero block, it might assume a certain bigger size, or if a button is in a section that has an inverted background color it might need to automatically switch to a different foreground / background color combination.
There are cases where within a given section / block context the author needs to be offered a set of explicit choices (eg. primary vs. secondary button) and in those cases we use combinations of bold and italic, usually bold for an explicit primary button and italic for an explicit secondary button.
It is conceivable that within a given block / section context there are more than four options for an author to choose from, in which case other formatting options could be used like underline, strikethrough etc. however, this is extremely rare and usually an indication that a decision that should be made within the design system is delegated to the author, leading to a less intuitive authoring experience.
Rule #7: Filenames matter to authors
There are a few content management systems that append trailing slashes to all their URLs and when migrating from websites that are powered by those systems an intuitive approach could be to map every single URL to an index (.docx or gdoc) inside a folder. The downside of this approach is that the filenames are not really useful anymore for authors when they are searching for files in gdrive and sharepoint.
A better approach is to remove the trailing slashes from the URLs and redirect with a 301 (usually from the redirects spreadsheet) from the existing URLs with a trailing slash to the URLs without a trailing slash.
(related: the same approach should also be used for other undesirable URLs for example URLs that end in .html)
There are situations where this change results in too much a temporary SEO impact, in which case rewriting the URLs on the CDN may be the appropriate option, however this should only be done if there is a quantifiable business impact. long term it is more desirable to have a clean URL that maps directly to the corresponding file in sharepoint or gdrive.
Rule #8: Access Controls and Content Grouping
It often makes sense to group content similar to how authoring teams are organized. A good way of thinking about this is that if you have a team that looks after the blog section on your website, technical documentation, support content, a particular country / language or a product it makes sense to keep that content together, and make sure that corresponding team has access to the content.
In organizations this often happens naturally, and it is intuitive for organizations to break up their content teams similar to the structure of their URL space. In some cases the URL structure doesn’t align with authoring teams (and the corresponding access control groups). In such a case combining multiple AEM projects on the CDN tier tying together content from different sources may be the right approach if the complexity and size of a site (single domain) gets overwhelming.While your content source (Sharepoint and Google Drive) possibly supports complex access control models, it is desirable to keep Access Control as simple as possible from a management standpoint.
Both Sharepoint and Google Drive have a concept for grouping content that helps to manage access control in a simple manner, in Sharepoint they are called “Sites” or “Libraries” and in Google Drive they are called “Shared Drives”. Both of those have predefined access control roles that are advantageous to use for simple group membership based access. Unless there are specific access control requirements it is recommended to keep access control to these OOTB groups.
Sites/Libraries and Share Drives are built to work well with a certain team and content size and complexity.
Particularly Sharepoint has best practices on access control complexity within a library, and creating access control complexity beyond that may yield undesirable results. In case you get to a place where it becomes unnatural to manage either the size of the content or the size and complexity in a single Site/Library or Shared Drive, it is likely that it makes sense to break things up into multiple different Site/Libraries or Shared Drives and blend the content together from different projects on the CDN.
Rule #9: Number of Blocks and Variants
Over the lifecycle of a website it is common that new blocks and variants are added. Especially for developers that are not very familiar with the existing block library of the project it is usually the easiest path to just add net new blocks or variants to make sure that there is no regression with existing content.
While it is probably not easy to avoid the sprawl of blocks and variants on projects that have a lot of functionality or justified requirements for a lot of visually diverse content within a single project, it is important to make sure that the core set of blocks and variant combinations that authors need to use commonly is limited. There are situations where special blocks are used infrequently on sites and often those are placed by developers initially, those blocks probably don’t need to be exposed to authors at the same level in documentation or a block library as the commonly used blocks.More generally, large block libraries and a lot of variant / section metadata combinations are less desirable. Maintaining a “minimum use” criteria for blocks and variants based on a content report is a good practice to deprecate and remove superfluous code from the block library that’s exposed to authors.
Rule #10: Limit number of Columns
A large number of columns is not a good ideal for authoring as there are practical horizontal screen / document size limitations. More importantly this is usually a symptom that content is split into small values that do not reflect a proper use of default content and the implied HTML semantics.There are some exceptions to this rule in cases where data is represented in a table, as opposed to content that should be a part of document semantics, and in those cases it is often useful to go the name-value pair route via a spreadsheet instead.
Rule #11: Use the block collection content models
The AEM Block Collection is a great source for well designed content models. If your block is producing a similar feature set as the one of the blocks in the Block Collection, the content model should be similar.
Rule #12: Fragments may be harmful
Fragments are very useful when the same content is used across a lot of different pages. Obvious good examples are header (navigation) and footer information that is identical throughout a site. These are great examples especially since authors of individual pages do not have to worry about that content showing up on their page, and there is no authoring impact.Using Fragments may also be useful in situations where there is an explicit selection of a content that is used across many pages of a site, such as a sign up form, a legal disclaimer, etc. and the content appears on a page but is not really a part of the canonical content of the page.
It is important to note that using a fragment comes at a cost of complexity and indirection for authors. Instead of seeing the actual content that is on a page, an author only sees a reference to a fragment, which makes it much less intuitive for authors to make changes and gauge the impact of their changes across pages. This is even amplified in cases of nested fragments.
Along those lines, from an SEO standpoint it is only advisable to use fragments at times where having duplicate content is acceptable (meaning that the content inside a fragment doesn't carry significant SEO weight for that page), hence content that is relevant from an SEO standpoint should always be placed on the page directly.
Rule #13: Don't overload image alt-text semantics
It may be convenient at times to put extra information hidden away into image alt-texts, but this is only recommended in exceptional cases.Alt-texts often cannot be easily discovered by authors, there is very little indication about their existence in common document authoring environments (eg. word or google docs).Depending on the type of copy/paste operation the alt-text may be lost without the author noticing, and if the alt-text contains special semantics, authors will have to be familiar with specific semantics within the value of an alt-text of individual images on a per block basis.

https://www.aem.live/docs/configuration

Project Configuration
The project configuration file is located in /.helix/config.xlsx (for sharepoint) or /.helix/config (for google drive). It consists of a table using Key and value columns. For example:
The format of the keys follows the identifier-dot notation, like in javascript. You can think of the sheets as a flattened JSON structure. If a key appears more than once, it would form an array, eg:
Will conceptually be a structure like:
The following table lists the configuration options of a project.
Also see the JSON Schema and Typescript Types of this config.
Blueprints
A project can define configuration blueprints that serve as defaults for the config.
The blueprints are defined in the .helix directory of the github repository. eg:
The .helix/blueprint-config.json contains the blueprint configuration
The .helix/blueprint-targets.json contains the list of allowed projects that can use the blueprint
The blueprint-targets.json needs to be a JSON array with the owner/repo names, eg:
Each project wanting to use the blueprint will need to register the blueprint configuration repository using the blueprint property in .helix/config.json (see configuration options above) and be listed in the .helix/blueprint-targets.json in the blueprint configuration repository.
This two-way referencing is needed to ensure that no project can steal the configuration of another one,And that no blueprint repository can force their config on an unrelated project.
Note: The blueprints configuration are only applied when the respective configuration files (/.helix/config, /.helix/headers, /metadata) are previewed, but not when the blueprint config is pushed.
The blueprints contain the defaults for the project config (as described above). They can also provide defaults for the headers and metadata configuration and have the following structure:
The metadata and the headers config follow the Modifiers format, which are an array of key/value pairs within path glob objects. Eg:

How to use Adobe Sharepoint
NOTE: This only applies for projects on Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) . For projects using a non Adobe Sharepoint, please continue here.
Setting up sharepoint involves the following steps:
Create a folder within sharepoint that will be the website root.
Share the website root folder with that user.
Configure the fstab.yaml with the respective folder
1. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in sharepoint and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a sharepoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
3. Share the website root folder
Ensure that the helix@adobe.com user has edit rights on the website root folder. This can be achieved easily by clicking on the … ellipsis menu and selecting “Manage Access”.
And then add the user via the “Direct access” option.
4. Configure the fstab.yaml
The next step is to configure the mountpoint in the fstab.yaml to point to the website root. It usually has the form of
But this might vary depending on how you create the sharepoint site and lists. In order to obtain the url, the simplest way is to copy-past the first part from the browser address, eg:
And then add the rest manually (Note, that copying the sharelink via the UI adds unnecessary information and it is better to use a canonical representation of the url). Once you composed the url, you can test it by entering it again in the browser. You should end up in the folder view of your website root.
After that, update the fstab.yaml accordingly.
For example:
To finalize the configuration, commit the fstab.yaml back to the main branch.

How to use Sharepoint (delegated)
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) please continue here.
If you use SharePoint as your content source, AEM uses a registered Microsoft Azure application to do so. This application has delegated permissions defined that allow the service to access SharePoint on behalf of a user. This user needs to be registered to the project that is using SharePoint.
Alternatively, the services can also authenticate as an application and use application permissions to access the sites. This needs additional setup by a SharePoint site administrator that can grant the permissions for the application.
The preferred setup is to use application permissions, as this narrows down the access the service has to a specific SharePoint site and does not require to share any secrets of a technical user. Also, it reduces the problems around password rotation. Please continue here for instruction on how to do so.
The following describes how to set up delegated permissions for your project.
Setting up SharePoint involves the following steps:
Create a folder within SharePoint that will be the website root.
Create or define the (technical) user that will access the SharePoint content
Share the website root folder with that user.
Configure the fstab.yaml with the respective folder
Register the user with the service
1. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in SharePoint and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a SharePoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
2. Create or define the user
It is best practice to use a generic (or technical) user to access the content on behalf of the service. This is better than using an employee user account because the exact scope of the files the user can access can be defined. Furthermore, there is no risk losing access to the files, should that employee leave the company.
Every company has different procedures to create technical users, so ask your IT department on how to do this.
3. Share the website root folder
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) please see here.
Ensure that the service user has edit rights on the website root folder. This can be achieved easily by clicking on the … ellipsis menu and selecting “Manage Access”.
And then add the generic (or technical) user user via the “Direct access” option.
4. Configure the fstab.yaml
The next step is to configure the mountpoint in the fstab.yaml to point to the website root. It usually has the form of
But this might vary depending on how you create the SharePoint site and lists. In order to obtain the url, the simplest way is to copy-past the first part from the browser address, eg:

After that, update the fstab.yaml accordingly.
For example:
To finalize the configuration, commit the fstab.yaml back to the main branch.
5. Register the user
Overview
In order for the AEM service to access the authored content it needs a couple of information and setup. The AEM service (a cloud function) accesses the MS Graph API on behalf of a configured user. In order to do so, it needs to authenticate first in the context of an Application. This is important because the scopes given to the application define what permission the service has on the MS Graph API. For example, it should be allowed to read and write documents, but not to alter access control.
An application is represented as an “Enterprise Application” in the respective Active Directory of a tenant. The permissions given to that enterprise application ultimately define what the service can access in that tenant’s resources. Certain permissions need to be approved by an Active Directory administrator before a user can use the application. This so-called “admin consent” is a mechanism to verify and control which permissions apps can have. This is to prevent dubious apps from tricking users into trusting an app that is not official. Having the extra admin consent step allows IT security to control which apps the employees can use.
Access the Service Setup UI
To get started, open the Admin Service Setup UI and enter the GitHub URL of your project:
Then you need to “Sign In” with your personal user that has access to the website root. This is to verify that only people with sufficient credentials can manage the user registration.
1. Sign-in in the Registration Portal
View Enterprise Applications in Azure Portal
Assuming that so far no Franklin Enterprise Applications are present in Azure (Microsoft Entra Id)
Access Franklin Registration Portal
Go to https://admin.hlx.page/register, enter the github url of the project
Sign-in as non admin user
Sign in as a user that does not have admin permissions will show an error that it needs approval, i.e. the application needs admin consent.
Problem: Enterprise Application is not registered if a user never logs in.
Sign-in as admin user
One solution is to sign in as a user that does have admin permissions:
(note, at this point the Enterprise Application is still not registered in azure)
Franklin Registration Service visible in UI
If the admin logs in (without checking the checkbox and granting consent for everyone), the Enterprise application is present.
Create application using MSGraph or Powershell
Alternatively, you can create the Enterprise application via MSGraph or Powershell.
In order to make it visible in the azure UI you also need to add the WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp tag. This can be done directly when creating the application.Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
After that you still need to give admin consent, if you want a non admin user to login.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-configure?pivots=ms-graph
Review permissions
Note that the Franklin Registration Service (e34c45c4-0919-43e1-9436-448ad8e81552) application is only needed during registration to verify that the user has read access to the sharepoint. It has the following delegated permissions:
OpenidAllows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information.
ProfileAllows the app to see your users' basic profile (e.g., name, picture, user name, email address)
Files.ReadWrite.AllAllows the app to read, create, update and delete all files the signed-in user can access.
User logged in Registration portal
After completing this initial step, the user is logged in the registration portal
Connect the technical User
With the permission properly granted, you should be able to login properly to the Franklin Service Setup UI:
Click on “Connect User” and you should see a new login window, where you want to login with your technical user. This the the Franklin Service is requesting for more permissions to access sharepoint:
Similar to above, and administrator needs to consent to the permissions:
After the login process, the UI should show the connected user information:
Once the user is registered, you should be able to preview a page.
Important
Changing the user's password will invalidate the grant that is established when connecting the user. This will eventually cause an error in the sidekick. In order to prevent this, you need to reconnect the user, by clicking the disconnect button then connect it again.

Metadata
Notes:
The Metadata table is handled by HTML rendering service internally to add <meta> tags in the <head> of the HTML markup delivered from the service. There should only be one Metadata table per page and while its placement doesn’t matter, by convention it is placed at the bottom of the document.
The metadata table is essentially following an intuitive name/value pair structure where the name is in the first column of the table and the value is in the second column.
There are a few well-known properties that behave according to the HTML specification and popular additional metadata schemes like og: and twitter: the well known metadata properties include Title, Description, Image, Tags and Feed.
Beyond the well-known properties there are some special semantics for Theme and Template that are added as classes to the <body> tag by the boilerplate code and are often used for styling and autoblocking.
Beyond that a project can add an arbitrary number of name value pairs that get added as <meta> tags to the markup, and can be used with project specific semantics.
Example:

Content Structure:

Code:
The metadata table is processed as part of the HTML rendering service. There is no project code related to the processing.

Footer (Block)
Notes:
The footer block is loaded by default in the boilerplate project into the <footer> element.Out-of-the-box it provides a simple example for a footer but is likely to be extended or adjusted on the per project basis.
The footer block is usually not referenced by authors but is loaded automatically on every page.
The content for the footer is loaded as a fragment and is by default authored in a footer (or footer.docx) document.As footer structure and designs change rarely and are usually visually very different from the rest of the blocks on a site, it is often a good strategy to divide the content into sections and decorate specific classes onto the sections based on their sequence and apply CSS styling to those classes.
The footer document has its own lifecycle and when previewed or published applies to all pages that use a given navigation.
It is not uncommon to have multiple footer documents for a site eg. one per locale / language.

The header block is usually not referenced by authors but is loaded automatically on every page.
The content for the navigation is loaded as a fragment and is by default authored in a nav (or nav.docx) document, and structured primarily into three sections for branding, navigation sections (nested <ul>) and tools.
The nav document has its own lifecycle and when previewed or published applies to all pages that use a given navigation.

Section Metadata table follows an intuitive name/value pair structure where the name is in the first column of the table and the value is in the second column.
The Style property is translated into a class while any other name will be transformed into a data-* attribute.

Headings
Notes:
Semantic headings are the backbone of any document structure. In documents you should always follow the semantic hierarchy of your document, meaning that a Heading 1 should contain a Heading 2 which in turn should contain a Heading 3 and so forth.In cases where you find yourself using the headings out of sequence or leaving gaps in the heading hierarchy, that’s usually an indication that you are either trying to use headings to adjust to visual or design constraints or you are using headings for something that is semantically not a heading. Either of those can lead to bad results.
According to Web best practices there should only be a single Heading 1 per page, which will also be used as the default title for the document.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The Content Structure leverages the built-in Heading 1 - Heading 6 mapped to h1 through h6.
See Content in Document
Code:
As headings are default content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.
There is no code related to list generic styling in Boilerplate.

https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/text

Text
Notes:
A Text Paragraph (or Copy) is the most common element on websites. AEM understands and translates a number of semantic formatting like bold, italic, underline, strike-through as well as subscript and superscript, which are translated to their respective semantic HTML tags of <strong>, <em>, <u>, <s>, <sup> and <sub>.
CSS styling may take hints from these formatting options and use them to express visually very different styling. Both a paragraph and line-feed are supported.
The first portion of the first text paragraph serves as the default description for the a page if nothing else is specified in metadata.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The content structure is based on the simple Normal Text paragraphs in word or google doc.

Images
Notes:
Pictures, Illustrations and Images are an integral part of making a web experience both more informative and also more engaging. Simply add images to your documents either by inserting them or just copy/paste images from your source.
Add Alt-texts to your images to make your content more accessible. Both Word and Google Docs have great support for that.
AEM automatically takes care of resizing the images to the appropriate size for the website and converting them into the formats that make sense for the consuming browser.
We recommend inserting your images with at least a width of 2000 pixels if available, so even at a large display resolution the images will still be crisp.
The first image on a page will automatically become the image that is used in metadata (for social media and messaging applications) unless defined otherwise in metadata.
Special Mention for GDocs: Google downsizes the images to a maximum of 1600 pixels width or 1600 height. This is still sufficient for most use cases of photography images, but for some illustrations it can lead to visible artifacts.

Lists
Notes:
Lists serve many purposes in the Web in general, some uses or obvious lists inside default content, while others are used in navigations or other hierarchical constructs.
Extraction of nested numbered lists and bullet lists is supported. Lists are converted to the <ol> and <ul> HTML tags respectively.
Complex list items seem to be hard to manage in word processing without accidentally being broken up so it is generally recommended to keep lists relatively simple when it comes to the complexity of the items in the list.

Links
Notes:
Hyperlinks are essential to connect websites and your content. To create a link, just use the insert link option in word or google doc.
Links can be added across all the default content and the different formatting options.
In Word and Google Docs only absolute links are accepted, which is usually easier to copy paste from your browser. Links are automatically converted to be relative to your site, while external links are kept absolute.
Links are often used beyond text links and reference for example embedded media or referenced fragments that are inlined in the page.

Code:
As links are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.There is no link related styling code in the boilerplate project.
Special Mention: Microsoft Word Online does not allow links on images, so a workaround would be to let authors put a link directly below the image and then wrap it on the client side, e.g.
Special Mention: It is recommended to handle certain links that need to be opened in a new window based on whether they are external links or PDFs (for example) on the client side, e.g.

Buttons
Notes:
Websites very often contain buttons, as call to actions or more generically. By default in the Boilerplate project buttons are created as a link in a paragraph by itself.
Bold and Italic (<strong> and <em>) and possibly combinations thereof are used to specify certain types of buttons. There are often primary and secondary buttons and the default styling is usually defined for default content and/or specified by a containing block, and Bold and Italic can be used to specify alternative variations of buttons.
Example:

Notes:
Most technical documentation websites (including this one) have the need to display code. Most marketing websites don’t have that requirement, but since there is an intuitive and simple styling and markup the notion of code elements both inline and preformatted multiline is supported out of the box.
Formatting something in word or gdoc as a fixed font (eg. Courier New) will automatically output a <code> element or a <code> and <pre> block for multiline.

Sections
Notes:
Sections are the top level grouping mechanism in documents, think of them as containers for a set of default content and blocks. Learn more about the Document Structure here.
Sections are separated by “Horizontal Rules” or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together, a simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.
Technically a section just introduces a <div> wrapper in the markup delivered around all the blocks and default content contained in the section.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
In most cases generic sections don’t have much styling code beyond project specific box layout (eg. margins, padding, max-width) and are sometimes augmented with section metadata to control styling (often background colors or images).

Icons
Notes:
Most if not all websites have icons, therefore there is a simple way to reference icons for authors.
Icons are referenced as :<iconname>: notation. As there are different ways to implement icons in the browser either as plain css classes, icon fonts or SVG, we offer a non-intrusive way to support all of those.
The boilerplate project includes an automatic mechanism to insert SVGs into the icon `<span>`s as that’s the most common way to deal with icons.
While some icons need to be in the code (icons referenced in blocks for example), there are times when authors need to add and reference new icons and update them on an ongoing basis. These icons can and should live with the content under an /icons/ folder in the content source (eg. Sharepoint or Google Drive). These icons can also be referenced the exact same way using the :<iconname>: notation. This will allow marketers to add and update icons they need for content without any dependency on a code change.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The :<iconname>: can be inserted as a part of all Default Content constructs.
See Content in Document
Code:
Icons are Default Content and are styled in project specific CSS code. If there is any JavaScript that is required to load the SVGs it can be adapted as needed.This code is included in Boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.

Embed (Block)
Notes:
It is very common on news and blog websites that videos or social media is embedded in a website.The embed block provides a simple blueprint with some of the most popular embeds as examples.It is likely that this block will be extended with specific social media, video or other embeddable widgets according to a website’s specific needs.
While it is tempting to add as many embeddable URLs into the embed block as possible, we will try to keep the embed block in the block collection to very commonly used platforms, and therefore keep the block simple and easy to extend.
Example:

Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
This code is included in Block Collection, simply copying the .css file and the .js file will add this block to your project.

Modal
Notes:
A modal is a popup that appears over other site content. It requires a click interaction from the user to open, and another interaction to close before they can return to the site underneath.
The modal is not a traditional block. Instead, links to a /modals/ path automatically create a modal.

This is a visual comparison tool for comparing webpages. Oftentimes while working on styling changes for a site, we want to assess the impact of that change throughout the site. Doing this manually for all the pages is a tedious process. With this tool, this task is automated to a considerable extent. 
Once the branch reference and the list of URLs is provided to it for visually testing, it goes through all the URLs on the "main" and "test" branches and loads them in a Playwright based headless browser, takes screenshots and records the differences. 
The tool informs the user about the differences and provides location of the screenshots where the differences can be reviewed.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 0
Introduction to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services

Back to Top
Introduction
I am a developer; arrays start at element 0, or I began writing with part 1 and now need an introduction. You choose.
This series of articles discusses developing with Adobe’s Edge Delivery Services in the Context of Document Authoring.
What is Document Authoring?
Creating and publishing content in the digital landscape involves multiple steps and stakeholders. Subject Matter Experts generate original content, which goes through an approval process. The approved content is then passed to Content Authors, who copy and paste sub-edited content into the Content Management System (CMS) for publishing. This process can be time-consuming, especially in regulated industries, where the approval process can take a long time.
Content Authors dislike CMS systems. They are forced to use “components” and “templates” created by technicians, using “page properties” and “dialog boxes” to pull the whole piece together; they have to sub-edit the copy because it often won’t fit in the constraints of the CMS. They usually have to backport the content to the original document format as a system of record. Returning the document to the SME with a link to the final web-page page.
Product Owners dislike CMS systems, especially in regulated industries. They must get approval for every line of text they place on the web. Regulated industries, like pharmaceuticals, automobile makers, insurers, etc., are legally bound by the content they publish and the corporation's stringent requirements. One product owner I know of asked that pre-approved Excel spreadsheets drive the entire CMS; however, the technicians have built the components and templates around dialogue boxes. He, too, had to use the copy-paste methodology.
Enter Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services from Adobe, sometimes called EDS. This system stands out for its innovative approach to web publishing and promises to redefine efficiency and simplicity in the industry.
It is a cutting-edge document-based CMS, named in tribute to Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial in deciphering DNA's structure. It has transformed from the "Helix" concept to the current "Edge Delivery Services," signifying its growth from a rudimentary tool to a comprehensive digital content management solution. It has shared all three names in its lifetime: Franklin, Helix and now Edge Delivery Services.

Conclusion:Edge Delivery Services is a powerful tool for businesses looking to enhance their online presence. Its focus on speed, scalability and ease of use can help companies to create engaging and compelling digital experiences.
Weighing the Benefits and Limitations
Edge Delivery Services is designed to deliver content with unparalleled efficiency, addressing the challenges of handling extensive information without compromising performance. It opens the content management field to a broader audience, enabling more professionals to contribute effectively. However, it's essential to acknowledge that Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services may not be the one-size-fits-all solution for every scenario, mainly where intricate customization and deep content modelling and structuring are paramount. Edge Delivery Services offers deeper integration with traditional AEM for requests that require content modelling and deeper integration with the back-end. Adobe has you covered. Think of Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services as the rapid delivery of traditional documents - ‘a Content Marketing System’. When customers require more sophisticated back-ends, AEM Authoring with Edge Delivery Services is ready to take up the workload and continue to integrate with the document authoring solutions in place.
Is it Edge Delivery Service or Edge Delivery Services?
Good question. It is Edge Delivery Services, as many different services are involved in delivery at the Edge (close to the customer). There are asset services, authentication services, JSON services, content services, and CDN (Content Delivery Network) services. The Adobe-provided services run on ADOBE IO, a serverless environment.
Edge Delivery Services is the final publishing point; many projects provide content for this platform.
At the time of writing, there are three providers (in order of appearance):
gdocs2md (Google)
word2md (Microsoft)
html2md (Bring your own markup)
The last one supports:
Crosswalk, Commerce, and Dark Alley. Universal Editor is something that is sitting on top of Crosswalk (from the perspective of Edge Delivery Services)
Project Helix (which was later extended into Franklin) covers delivery, authoring (through Sidekick), and integration (through the Admin API). To refer to the Word and Google integration only as Helix isn't how the Adobe team has been looking at it - and still isn't, as they use Helix now to refer to the same core architecture.
Edge Delivery Services (for AEM Sites) includes only the delivery part, as far as the product is packaged. There is no official name for the whole stack.
This is a complex relationship, making discussion challenging. I will focus on Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Each provider creates digital entities that are stored in a content bus. This includes content from cloud-based sources, including code, assets, text, HTML, JSON and configuration data. The platform serves the content bus.
It is essential to keep these two entities separate in your mind. There are providers, and Edge Delivery Services is the platform.
Why invest in this technology?
Performance. Edge Delivery Services is faster, which increases customer engagement. There are lots of studies showing that speed counts. Adobe wants to create the world's fastest websites, so it experimented to see what would happen if all our customers had the world's fastest sites! So Adobe did this.
Surely a CDN does this for AEM?
It helps, but there is more than just CDN delivery. CDNs are great for global audiences, but users usually have multiple CDNs, dispatcher caches, Akamai, etc. Edge Delivery Services is not a CDN. It sits side by side, feeding one CDN! It runs next to your CDN, not in parallel.
What speed do we expect?
Lighthouse has its challenges. Edge Delivery Services sends pages optimally, not including any JS cumulative layout shift. If you get 100 on Lighthouse, you will be among the fastest in the world. Adobe aimed for 80-100 for Edge Delivery Services, and they achieved it.
Is this just for static content?
Great question. The magic is caused by rethinking resources, with a server component that organises the resources and a client part that personalises. Working together, these two parts allow super-fast dynamic page content. Adobe first focused on what was visible to the user, improving static and dynamic pages. There is no such thing as a static page in Edge Delivery Services.
Did Adobe create a new JS framework to do this?
Current front-end frameworks are designed around limitations in the stack, but browsers have improved, protocols have changed, HTTP/3 is available, and limitations are gone. So Adobe does not call what they are doing a “framework”; it is the web platform. Adobe uses the best bits from the new world. In the old world, software used a bundler to consume assets and placed it on a server for a client to consume. Edge Delivery Services is a no-bundler; source code coordination is used instead. The goal was to make Edge Delivery Services easy to use and make the time to rebuild a site super fast. Instead of incrementally adapting a site to a new design, authors use the tools they have learnt: Excel, Word, Google Drive, etc.
What does the platform bring?
Performance optimisation: Edge Delivery Services focuses heavily on web performance. It helps serve websites at lightning-fast speeds from edge locations (geographically closer to users) for lower loading times. Unmatched speed – get a Lighthouse reading of 100s.
Content at scale: It can handle thousands of pages. Adobe has 300,000+ pages on its website, as Edge Delivery Services pages.
Content first: Whether structured or unstructured, AEM prioritises your content, delivers it optimally, and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.
Enhanced developer experience: Edge Delivery Services empowers developers using modern front-end technologies and frameworks..
Real user monitoring (RUM) provides real-time performance metrics, so any dips or issues can be addressed quickly, maintaining a great user experience.
Flexibility: Edge Delivery Services is composable, meaning you can use only the specific services you need for your project. No matter where your data is, you can bring it into Edge Delivery Services.
Why Edge Delivery Services Matters
Website speed and user experience are crucial. Edge Delivery Services helps businesses achieve:
Faster time to market: Get content updates live much quicker. With its serverless, lightweight approach to web development, Edge Delivery Services allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
Improved SEO: Faster websites get a boost in search rankings.
Increased customer engagement: A smooth, fast website keeps users engaged, leading to potentially higher conversion rates.
Zero backend development: No building via Maven, Grunt, etc. Edge Delivery Services uses everything modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, and simplicity. And none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead, no pipelines.
Low-code productivity: No frameworks, plain HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Simple to onboard devs: no backend (needs repeating!).
One less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software-as-a-service, and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
From Cedric Heusler: The short version is that we are building the “bottomless CMS” - a set of CMS services independent of the content. The content is either already in the cloud (SharePoint, etc.) or managed with a domain-specific workflow AND in a CMS. All this content comes together in the brand/enterprise experience.
How does Edge Delivery Services differ from AEM?
Unlike traditional content management systems (CMSs), this solution does not require a dedicated authoring or publishing environment. Instead, it leverages platforms like Google Drive or SharePoint to create and manage content published directly to Edge Delivery Services for fast and reliable delivery to end-users. This serverless approach eliminates the need for complex infrastructure and maintenance, making it a cost-effective and scalable option for content delivery.
Components can be used immediately as the pages have been built beforehand, eliminating the need to wait for a CDN call to the dispatcher or for the components to run on a publisher.
No bundling of JS/CSS (Clientlibs).
The code relies solely on modern JavaScript and CSS without needing external JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
Pages are controlled through spreadsheets, redirects, indexes, and metadata, all converted into JSON by Edge Delivery Services.
Paths in Google Drive/SharePoint control the tree structure of pages.
Plug-in tools like Asset Picker from Adobe and Translate from Google can be used.
Developers store code in GitHub: no build to deploy.
Each branch in GitHub has a separate live preview.
Zero pipelines, no delay in publishing. Fast.
Did I say fast and easy using tools you already know?
To end this introduction, I must create a ‘hello world’ for Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Code is coordinated by scripts.js in the scripts folder.
You can see the code in scripts that control loading:
This pattern is known as E-L-D, Eager, Lazy, Delayed, which optimizes the page loading sequence to help us get to the 100/100/100/100 model.
Earlier in the sequence, scripts.js inspects the page held in the content bus and modified to be the intermediate state; the code scans for ‘blocks’ and when finding one, it injects the cs and javascript, executing the JS if any is placed in line.
Creating HelloWorld
I will assume that you have cloned the https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate repo and setup your Edge Delivery Services folder following Getting Started – Developer Tutorial (www.aem.live)
To create a simple "Hello World" block in Edge Delivery Services, you'll need to create a CSS file for styling and a JavaScript file for functionality. Here's how you can do it:
Create a new folder named "helloworld" in your blocks directory in the GitHub repository
Create two files inside the "helloworld" folder: helloworld.css and helloworld.js.
In helloworld.css, add the following content:
In helloworld.js, add the following content:
In your Google document, insert a table, one cell wide and one cell deep.
In this cell, add the text ‘helloworld’
The existence of the table with the first cell name is the link to the code; Edge Delivery Services looks in the blocks folder and cell-name folder for similarly named js and css, applying the js and the css to the DOM. Magic completed, and the results look like this.

Introduction
This is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.
I was only joking. Developers can type content.
This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.
Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.
All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.
This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.
The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they need to adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.
This can be a long process. Perhaps templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Franklin (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.
If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.
Beginning with a simple page,
We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:
The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.
The system then creates a web page.
Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:
What happened?
The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.
Also note that the domain name, in this case main--allaboutv2--ddttom was taken from my GitHub branch, repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.
A default image tag for og:image:secure_url, og:image and twitter:image has been provided. I must provide this default image in my codebase.
The viewport tag has been provided.
Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loaded
I have an empty header and footer in my Franklin implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.
The main part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.
But what happens inside the browser?
You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Franklin provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.
Franklin has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our normal run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.
Franklin has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Franklin has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Franklin calls the components ‘blocks,’ so it adds the CSS to the DOM and runs the JS from the same folder.
.
We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Franklin, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:
Although it uses a more elegant method.
The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.
The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.
You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.
When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.
Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.
The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>
In summary, Franklin applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.
We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Franklin uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.
What’s this about rules?
Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Franklin tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.
The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Franklin to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.
The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.
What this metadata does to our HTML
In this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.
A new meta field has been added:
<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">
This ability to add rules to the document is key to creating interesting web pages.
We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.
Add a block called columns:
Now inspect the view page source. We will only look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.
The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Franklin to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.
Although we used a table to define our block, Franklin used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Franklin is much smarter than that.
Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged parts
The image in og:image and og:image:secure_url has been replaced from the default with the URL for the image in the metadata table.
This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Franklin creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"
The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Franklin will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.
We will add images to our simple website and see what Franklin offers later.
The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:
At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.
A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.
The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Franklin that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.
The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.
The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.
The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.
Adjusting our document and placing the same image at the top of the page, with author details.
I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.
Preview the page in the browser.
Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:
Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:
<meta property="og:image" content="https://main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.page/media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium">
The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers not supporting it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.
The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.
This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).
Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg
Creating a bio block
We will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.
<meta name="author" content="Tom Cranstoun">
The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.
The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.
Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.
Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:
We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:
We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with<div class="bio-wrapper">
<div class="bio block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
This allows us to target CSS onto the block.
We will put the bio picture into a circle.
The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.css
Developer Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery Services
We now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.
Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.js
Previewing the page:
By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now create a highlighted variation of the bio block.
We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.css
As we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version now shows the image with a 2px blue border.
The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.
Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:
Styling:
Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.
Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.
Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.

Creating a hero block
A hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.
We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.
When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.
Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.
You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.
You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.
How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.
Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.
When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.
Looking at the rendered HTML:
Add code to the hero block.
As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.
We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.js
The code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.
If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:
1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.
2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.
3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.
If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.
If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.
4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.
If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.
Just a little touch of magic.
See the screenshots below:
Desktop image
Mobile image
Finally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:
The two picture elements have been merged into one.
All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.
If you follow along, you will have a very similar page. See here An explanatory web page

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 2
Creating variations of our block
Automating Author Name from Alt Text
Place text to the right of BIO
Use of fragments
Theming
This post continues my Developer’s guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Previously
We created a Google Doc called ‘Hello World’. It has a hero and a bio block, with the line of text “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.”
We added a metadata table at the bottom of the document, and the entries became metadata on the final web page.
We added JavaScript to the hero block to allow the hero to contain two distinct images: one for mobile and one for desktop. The picture element selected these depending on the viewport size. We created the bio block from scratch, with styling to create a circular overlay and to pick up the author's name from either the alt tag in the img element and, if not present, obtain the author’s name from the author meta element from the page. We added a class name ‘highlighted’ to our Bio block and the CSS to put an outline on the image.
Continuing the journey
Our manager has asked that we follow the image with some text with brief biographical details, including the author's name. Thus, we no longer need the author's name automatically provided underneath the picture. This is another variation.
The cell in the block name is currently Bio (highlighted). The word bio is the block name and also the class name used to create the element and its wrappers; looking at the rendered HTML in the browser after Edge Delivery Services has run, one of the first things to note is that the blocks we created have been rendered in a div with a section class.
<div class="section hero-container bio-container columns-container" data-section-status="loaded" style="">
The div also has classes for each block in the document, postfixed with -container. There is a data-section-status class that is adjusted by edge delivery and, finally, an empty style; we will return to section styles later. Further down, we see the bio-block
In the snippet of HTML, the block is decorated with a -wrapper <div class="bio-wrapper">, and the next div is decorated with the block name ‘bio’ and the variation ‘highlighted’ along with a ‘block’ class.
<div class="bio highlighted block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
All blocks are decorated this way: block name, variations applied and then ‘block’. This makes it easy to target slices of the HTML using classes; Edge Delivery Services does not use IDs.
Hiding the auto-generated author-name
Our task is to hide the author, so adding a new class name, “hide author”, is done by adding a second phrase after a comma within the brackets. All spaces in the block/styling phrase are replaced with hyphens (-)
Investigating the rendered HTML.
We can adjust the CSS or JS to make this class work. I chose to adjust the javascript, adding a test for the non-existence of the class ‘hide-author.’
The final Javascript function
Place the text to the right.
The next task was to allow text to the right of our bio picture. Insert a new column, merge the title and add the text.
Previewing could be better; the text is underneath.
It looks OK, but we wanted something else. We want the text to be to the right. Adding CSS to bio.css to involve a flex layout does the trick.
We adjusted the first and last child of the DIVs to make it work
Reusing content
Content Management Systems often reuse pieces of text and assets; Edge Delivery Services include this functionality; these are called fragments.
I create fragments in a folder called fragments in my Google Drive. We want boilerplate text at the foot of our pages, similar to the ‘Want to know more’ at the bottom of these articles.
We create the fragment.
And add the content
We need to include this fragment in our page by adding a fragment block with the path of the fragment.
When previewed, we can now see the fragment on our page.
The ‘want to know more’ fragment is displayed on the page; it is interesting to see how Edge Delivery Services provides this snippet; we inspect the network traffic.
This time, you can see the fetch/xhr content in my filter, and the fragment component asked for want-to-know-more-plain.html instead of Edge Delivery providing a page with styling, javascript, <body>, <main>, etc.; it just provided the raw HTML in a div ready for adding to the page; where it will inherit the styling and context of the page.
Looking more carefully, you wiil also see footer.plain.html and nav.plain.html
These are ‘auto fragments’ generated from the footer and nav documents placed in the root folder of Google Drive. This gives the website a consistent set of headers and footers.
I want my allabout.network to be focussed on telling people ‘all about’ something, such as this tutorial, without third-party distractions. Therefore, I have also chosen not to have footers or navigation; you can easily create your navigation and footers and have them auto-included as fragments.
Styling the pages
There are three ways to style your pages.
Use the default autoblock style.
Change nothing; get the style verbatim from styles.css. You can view and change the styles in styles.css for your project. Note that the style sheets in Edge Delivery use CSS 3 with variables; it does not require bundling, compiling, or transpilation.
Use a theme
After applying the theme's name to your metadata table, Edge Delivery Services will apply the theme class to the body. Then, you can change the styling for this page using the theme as a modifier; for instance, a newsletter page could have a theme of ‘newsletter’; as I am writing an article, I will give this page a theme of ‘article’.
Edge Delivery Services applies the theme class to the body element.
One can use different styles on this page, such as margin padding.
Note that the body class has a display: none; when Edge Delivery finishes loading the page, it changes the display attribute by adding a class “appear” with a display “block”
Use sections
Sections are parts of the page; they are marked by ‘---’ 3 hyphens on a line by themselves and have a section metadata table.
Preview the page
The rendered HTML for a section looks like this:
The description metadata is used as a data-description attribute in the section div. You can use these data descriptions to decorate the HTML further, but this will be custom code.

A Manager’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services
This is a manager's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Although Edge Delivery Services is a serverless platform provided and maintained by Adobe, setting up the web hosting, GitHub, CDN (content delivery network) and DNS (domain name system) management requires some technical skill. This post assumes you have access to a technical team to do this with you.
I cover some of the technical aspects in a developer’s guide to Edge Delivery Services post here:
https://allabout.network/developer-guide-to-document-authoring-with-edge-delivery-services

Everything discussed below is identical if you have an existing Word or Google Doc. I will demonstrate importing an existing web page into the system.
Consider a web page such as
The AI Tipping Point: A Consultant's Takeaways from CMS Kickoff 2024 | CMS Critic
If we want to convert this page to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, we start with the AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) import command. The importer is currently named Franklin Import UI. Franklin is one of the internal product names; another used in the codebase is Helix. Helix refers to the DNA spiral and is used as a meme throughout the documentation and developer “getting started “ site: https://www.aem.live/home
I will continue to user Franklin in this document.
The Edge Delivery Services platform provides the security, scalability, and speed that Adobe offers for websites. Franklin is an individual project that utilizes the Edge Delivery Services content bus.The platform also includes other projects discussed in a separate blog post.
The importer reads the website and recognises the main content, removing the adverts. It then saves the content as a Word document. We edit the document to remove the menu hangover in Word or Google Docs and add a heading title format. That's all we have to do. The document is ready for Edge Delivery Services.
Upload to Google Drive (or SharePoint)
In Google Drive (or SharePoint), we can use the document's normal workflows, plugins, and tools, including translation, AI content enhancement, etc.
When we are ready, press Preview to check the website. Then press Publish, and the web page will be complete and ready for the public.
This technique is called ‘autoblocking’ in the Franklin project. We have not created any components, added fancy tags, or used JavaScript Blocks on the web page. We have taken a basic article with images and turned it into a reasonable web page. Franklin has preserved font emboldening, heading levels, and links and loosely styled them all, which Edge Delivery Services will serve fast.
Franklin understands the document's headings (h1, h2, etc.) and applies these values to the final web page. Franklin also understands bold, italic, and underlining. Franklin understands the Courier font as a code marker and outputs the content raw, without font decoration.
Adding new items
We want to be creative and add new items to our site. Let's explain how that works.
In the GitHub repository, we store individual code and styling in blocks. Your developers take care of these, and your integrator or developer team will provide some additional blocks.
When applying code or styling to a fraction of our web page, one adds a table with the block's name. Let’s add a centreblock:
This text will be centred on the web page. That’s all we have to do. If we wanted to do more, we could have various code and styling blocks, say, accordions, tabs, etc.
Many out-of-the-box blocks are available for Franklin; see Block Collection.Further down the page, you will see Block Party.
One can add teasers, heroes, accordions, tabs, etc. Your developers can create many more.
Metadata
Another feature of Franklin is a special block embedded in the HTML page containing the content and the values to be used as metadata. This block describes the page to external systems and configures the page for the Franklin project.
In each row below, the first column is the metadata keyword, and the second column is the value of the metadata element. We have multiple items: one for the page title, one for the page description; one for an image, and one for a line of extra data. The case is ignored in the first column. The metadata table is typically placed at the foot of the document, though this is not a requirement.
This metadata translates into the final HTML
I will cover metadata in detail in the developer's guide. It's good to know that Franklin covers metadata, that it is easily maintained by the content team, and that it may be used by Google or other indexers. Franklin may also use the metadata to change the page layout.
Preview and publish
Franklin contains a toolbar that allows authorised users to preview or publish pages via the Edge Delivery Services platform.
Pressing Preview allows the content author to see the final page, and then pressing Publish sends the page and its assets—the content, media, and code buses—to the public store.
The publish bus system stores the various elements of the web page in a publicly visible cloud storage system where the code bus provides the final code needed to serve the web page to the public. The Adobe code in the code bus is started by a JavaScript file embedded in the HTML, named aem.js. This orchestrates the delivery and sequencing of the assets, the other code blocks and only the blocks required for the current page. This is a speedy delivery, made faster by a bring-your-own CDN such as Fastly.
The assets bus provides images in a suitably rendered format using HTML picture elements, keeping the website fast and performant on mobile websites.
A properly implemented Edge Delivery Services page should have a great Core Web Vitals or Lighthouse score.Lighthouse performance scoring | Chrome for Developers
The Lighthouse score for this page is below:
The great score 100/100/100/100 comes out of the box. As you add scripts, especially third-party or monitoring scripts, you must continually monitor the performance to ensure the site performs as expected. Adobe provides great tools in the Franklin ecosystem, such as real user monitoring (RUM) and performance checks on GitHub. It helps you ensure you keep world-class speeds. Any Lighthouse score above 80 is at the top of the web.

This is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.
I was only joking. Developers can type content.
This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.
Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.
All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.
This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.
The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they need to adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.
This can be a long process. Perhaps templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Franklin (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.
If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.
Beginning with a simple page,
We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:
The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.
The system then creates a web page.
Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:
What happened?
The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.
Also note that the domain name, in this case main--allaboutv2--ddttom was taken from my GitHub branch, repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.
A default image tag for og:image:secure_url, og:image and twitter:image has been provided. I must provide this default image in my codebase.
The viewport tag has been provided.
Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loaded
I have an empty header and footer in my Franklin implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.
The main part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.
But what happens inside the browser?
You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Franklin provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.
Franklin has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our normal run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.
Franklin has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Franklin has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Franklin calls the components ‘blocks,’ so it adds the CSS to the DOM and runs the JS from the same folder.
.
We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Franklin, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:
Although it uses a more elegant method.
The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.
The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.
You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.
When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.
Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.
The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>
In summary, Franklin applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.
We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Franklin uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.
What’s this about rules?
Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Franklin tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.
The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Franklin to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.
The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.
What this metadata does to our HTML
In this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.
A new meta field has been added:
<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">
This ability to add rules to the document is key to creating interesting web pages.
We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.
Add a block called columns:
Now inspect the view page source. We will only look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.
The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Franklin to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.
Although we used a table to define our block, Franklin used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Franklin is much smarter than that.
Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged parts
The image in og:image and og:image:secure_url has been replaced from the default with the URL for the image in the metadata table.
This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Franklin creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"
The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Franklin will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.
We will add images to our simple website and see what Franklin offers later.
The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:
At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.
A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.
The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Franklin that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.
The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.
The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.
The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.
Adjusting our document and placing the same image at the top of the page, with author details.
I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.
Preview the page in the browser.
Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:
Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:
<meta property="og:image" content="https://main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.page/media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium">
The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers not supporting it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.
The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.
This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).
Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg
Creating a bio block
We will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.
<meta name="author" content="Tom Cranstoun">
The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.
The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.
Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.
Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:
We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:
We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with<div class="bio-wrapper">
<div class="bio block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
This allows us to target CSS onto the block.
We will put the bio picture into a circle.
The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.css
Developer Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery Services
We now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.
Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.js
Previewing the page:
By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now create a highlighted variation of the bio block.
We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.css
As we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version now shows the image with a 2px blue border.
The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.
Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:
Styling:
Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.
Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.
Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.

By combining styling and JavaScript introspection, blocks can be created that are visually appealing and interactive, creating a more engaging and enjoyable user experience.
Creating a hero block
A hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.
We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.
When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.
Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.
You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.
You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.
How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.
Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.
When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.
Looking at the rendered HTML:
Add code to the hero block.
As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.
We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.js
The code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.
If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:
1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.
2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.
3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.
If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.
If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.
4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.
If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.
Just a little touch of magic.
See the screenshots below:
Desktop image
Mobile image
Finally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:
The two picture elements have been merged into one.
All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 3
Spreadsheets
Indexing
Spreadsheets and Json
Query parameters
Redirects
.helix folder
This is part 3 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Previously
We extended ‘Hello World’ with style variations on the bio block, added fragments, and discussed styling in more depth.
Next - We can use spreadsheets, not just documents.
Within Google Drive or Sharepoint, you can upload or create spreadsheets in Excel or Google Sheets format. If you are using Google Drive, remember to change your settings to convert Excel to Google Sheets automatically,How to Convert Multiple Word Documents/Sheets to Google Docs.
Using spreadsheets
Spreadsheets are versatile tools that can be used for various purposes. In this post, we will explore some of the most common uses for spreadsheets, including:
Source of JSON for your website: Spreadsheets can create JSON data that populates Edge Delivery Services pages or another website using ‘headless technologies’ such as react.js. They are a convenient way to store and manage data that needs to be displayed on a website.
Notification of events from Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to receive notifications of events from Edge Delivery Services. This can be useful for monitoring your website's performance or troubleshooting issues. The Spreadsheets created can be used on your website; we will demo this.
Configuration of Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to configure Edge Delivery Services. This optimises your website's performance or enables specific features like headers, metadata, and authentication.
1 Use a spreadsheet as a source of JSON for websites.
One can create a spreadsheet in MS Excel and upload it to Google Drive or create one directly inside Google Drive. For the demo, we will create a fortune cookie block in our document that displays a random cookie from a JSON file named cookies.
In Google Drive, create a folder named /data; in that folder, create a sheet named cookies.
The first row of the sheet becomes the json attribute names.
We now want a list of cookies, and I will get chatGPT to give me a list of 9
Press the preview button in the sidekick to see a nice json layout; I use json view.
Investigating the structure of the json.
The JSON structure consists of an object with several properties:
1. "total": A number representing the total count of data elements.
2. "offset": A number indicating the starting position of the data subset.
3. "limit": A number specifying the maximum number of data elements in this subset.
4. "data": An array containing the actual data elements. Each element is an object with two properties:
- "key": A string representing the message's short title
- "value": A string containing the actual message.
5. ":type": A string indicating the type of data, in this case, "sheet", the source of the data
In simple terms:
- The object has metadata about the data set, including the total number of elements, the offset and limit for this subset of data (useful for pagination), and the data type.
- The actual data is in the "data" array.
All JSON derived from spreadsheets in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services share the same formatting; the main json is in the ‘data’ element, and everything else is metadata.
We would like to build a fortune cookie block.
Start by creating a table ‘FortuneCookie’ in our Hello World document.
Remember that the name cell, the only cell in the case above, is changed to lowercase when used in Edge Delivery Services.
In our GitHub, we need to createblocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.css and
blocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.js
The code in fortunecookie.js will use the browser's fetch command to read the json, generate a random number, use that number to pluck a key and a value, and then place the results in the block.
Viewing the page
We now have a Fortune Cookie on our page. You can add any JSON to your pages by using spreadsheets when someone presses preview and publish.
Spreadsheets and JSON
In addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that your website or web application can easily consume.
This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.
Sheets and Sheet Structure.
The simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data, as seen above.
Edge Delivery Services allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.
If there is only one sheet, Edge Delivery Services will use that sheet as the default source of information.
Edge Delivery Services will only deliver sheets with sheet names prefixed with helix if there are multiple sheets. This lets you keep additional information and possibly formulas in the same spreadsheet that will not be delivered to the web.
If there is a sheet named helix-default, it is delivered if no additional query parameters are supplied.
See the following for details on how to query a specific sheet.
Query Parameters
Offset and Limit
Spreadsheets and JSON files can become very large. In such cases, Edge Delivery Services supports limit and offset query parameters to indicate which spreadsheet rows are delivered.
As Edge Delivery Services always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore, if the limit query parameter is not specified, the Edge Delivery Services limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 by default. This is sufficient for many simple cases.
Sheet
The sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. For example,?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named helix-jobs, and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for helix-jobs and helix-articles.
2 Notification of events from Edge Delivery Services
The empty sheet
Edge Delivery Services keeps a json index of all published pages; in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, you can have a copy of this index by creating a sheet in the root folder of your document store. This sheet must be named query-index and have a single sheet named raw_index. The columns are path, title, image, description and lastmodified. You can choose to add others like ‘author’. See indexing
When you publish a page, Edge Delivery automatically enters it into this spreadsheet with updated attributes and publishes the sheet. It's a two-way traffic sheet.
Using this documentation website as an example
And when we preview
This json file can be used in Edge Delivery Services to create dynamic blocks, where the content is pulled from a json file.
Creating a BlogList, using index-query.json
We added a bloglist block to the document.
We will create the bloglist code at
/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.css and/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.js
Bloglist Javascript
The javascript will also use fetch, which is similar to the fortunecookie block. We want to obtain the json, restrict it to just my blogs, sort by title, and then restrict the final json to three entries. You can see four entries in the sample above.
Create the BlogList style
Previewing the page
3 Configuring Edge Delivery Services
Edge Delivery Services is controlled in many ways; spreadsheets are the content Author-friendly way of performing this task.
Redirects
You have seen that we created a query-index sheet in our root folder. This is a two-way sheet that receives information from the publishing process and can be used to create dynamic content for your pages.
Edge Delivery Services also has a sheet named redirects, which creates the json entity redirects.json
In this sheet, we have two columns: Source and Destination.
I made the mistake of creating my blogs in the root folder of my Google Drive, and I did not similarly name them, so I moved them to a subtree ‘/blogs/ddt’ and created the redirects sheet in the root of the folder.
I also deleted the original pages, so you are redirected to the new destination when you ask for the older location: nice one, Adobe. Thinking about your hierarchy before you begin is preferable, but knowing that you can change it afterwards is nice.
The .helix folder
You can control the inner workings of Edge Delivery services using the folder named .helix
Note the ‘.’ -- it is dot-helix .helix
Note the name is a previous code name for this technology. The dot in front makes this folder unservable from the internet, which is excellent for secrets like how you are configuring Edge Delivery Services. You could think of the ‘.’ as just like the dot in Unix -- files are hidden!!
Anyway, the files you create in this folder are used for configuring Helix
Headers
The sheet ‘headers’, which in turn ought to create headers,json - you cannot see this file, contains the key and value of the headers you want to send out with your web pages.
My headers contain a content security policy, which helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.Link to CSP Description on Mozilla
Bringing up the sidekick
When you click on preview, instead of a new set of options, including publish, you get a transient sign ‘Configuration successfully activated’.
Because this is in the .helix folder, it does not need publishing -- it is not visible to the internet.
Config
The next sheet to look at is config; you put interesting things here for your configuration.
Part of mine is shown below; keys and secrets are here to configure CDN and caching; you can also configure authentication. I will not show you my samples for the obvious reasons.
You can find more info about the ‘.helix’ folder and metadata config here.

My next post will be about tips and tricks with Json, including building a react application inside Edge Delivery Services.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 4
Building an SPA app with Json
This is part 4 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create an SPA app.
Previously
We demonstrated how spreadsheets can serve as a JSON source for websites and Edge Delivery Services, as well as for notifications and configuration purposes.
Part 4 - Building an App with Json
I will first create an application in Edge Delivery Services and then extend this to a React application. Edge Delivery Services supports react and vue; one does not get the perfect 100,100,100,100 lighthouse scoring when we move to Single Page Applications (SPAs), though we get enhanced user interactions. This article shows how Edge Delivery Services can assist customers in building the best of both worlds. Architects should ensure that the home, campaign, and direct landing pages are built with pure Edge Delivery Services code; secondary pages can be more interactive, keeping the website's performance high. Like all rules, you can choose to disregard this one.
The app we build will demonstrate that Edge Delivery Services is not just for static pages.
Specification of the App
The app is a slideshow designed for content authors who create individual pages.
In a ‘traditional CMS, ’ this would probably be a pool of images in an extendable component, which is difficult for a content author to use. We will build a design focused on the content author.
Each page will also serve as a standalone entity, with a visually appealing slide image complemented by detailed textual content. The code's primary objective is to extract metadata from each page, represented as a JSON object. This metadata is then employed to showcase the slides in a continuous scrolling format, providing users with an immersive experience; each slide is linked to its corresponding page, enabling seamless navigation for users seeking additional information or exploring the content in greater depth.This feature enhances the user experience by allowing easy access to supplementary materials, fostering a more interactive and informative environment.
Creating the documents
Create a folder ‘slides’ in the root folder of our Google Drive, and create our page in this folder.
As a subject, I will create slides about York, the English city where I live. I will create five pages with images and information. The code will not be restricted to five pages; use as many as you need.
My pages will be simple to show the context of creating an SPA, and the layout will be
Title, Image, Descriptive text, Metadata
Similar to this, each page is different, and it will expand on the text.
Accessing the pages
Query-index
All pages created? Add a query-index spreadsheet in the folder; we covered this in part three when we created a query-index in the root folder. As a reminder, we want a blank like this.
Now preview and publish the pages.
Edge Delivery Services populates the query-index
We can look at the json
We should create the landing page.
“Five things to do in York, England”
In this page we added a single block ‘slide builder’; which will contain the JavaScript and styling for our SPA.
Remember that Edge Delivery Services replace non-printing, and strange characters with hyphens; we need to create our files in
/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.css
/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.js
The JS is the first thing I will create. We use ‘fetch’ to obtain the json from our query-index in the slides folder of the Google Drive, iterate over every entry and make the initial page markup.
We will develop the code step by step.
As usual, we start with our export statement; it is good practice to do this
We have started with a query to check if WebP, high-speed images, is supported.
We will layer this up as we go through the tutorial.
Fetch the slides
There are two functions here; the first fetch retrieves the query-index inside the /slides/ folder, which lists the published slide we saw in the json above.
However, each slide page has information we want for the SPA, a hero-type image with variations for mobile etc, the intro para and detailed paragraphs; we need to pick those up too. We bypass this in a mobile view (viewport <800). In the mobile view, the html is replaced by a null. The fetchSlideHtml function appends ‘.plain.html’ to the path; this signals to Edge Delivery Services to treat the page as a fragment and only return plain html without a header footer or any javascript - just plain html.
If returned, it is stored in the json for later use.
Next step, add the slides.
We Iterate over the json and call functions to build our app; we use an intersection observer feature to lazy load our images. That bit that says rootMargin: 100px is the wiggle room for our image coming into view.
Create each slide
The createSlideItem function builds all of the html necessary to display an individual slide, adding a click handler, which creates a panel; if we are running on a desktop, it adds additional supporting text (the first paragraph from the HTML) to the slide.
This technique speeds up mobile whilst keeping the desktop view enriched. The design is mobile-first, desktop-enriched.
The CreatePanel Function
In the createPanel we check to see if the HTML is present to display; if not we fetch it. Remember it is not present on the mobile view; keeping this responsive and fast. We add the controls to dismiss the panel.
FetchSupportingText Function
The FetchSupportingText function reads the HTML, if present, from the html node of the Json, parses it with the Dom Parser and extracts the first paragraph after the first h2 element. This is an essential technique in Edge Delivery Services; the web uses modern javascript, and the browsers fully support parsing DOM structures. Edge Delivery services treat the DOM as a first-class citizen, tying this with ‘plain.html’, and developers have a rich resource set.
Setting the background image
Two things are happening here: the url is constructed from the original image url, which was present in the metadata, and therefore, the image node of the json. We use the supportsWebP variable to adjust the image for WebP serving from Edge Delivery, set width and optimise level through a query string. We go for the original image if the browser does not support WebP.
Notice that we have img.onload and image.onerror functions to support lazy loading.
That was a lot to cover
Here is the complete listing
Completing the ask, the CSS
Phew that is complicated; by breaking it into smaller pieces, I hope you see that the design fits together and you will be able to build SPA Applications with query-index.json and .plain.html
We managed to keep great lighthouse scores despite using lots of fetch and stitching together. Edge Delivery Services is a wonderful tool.
The finished Spa App is here Five things to do in York, England (allabout.network)
In contrast, we can convert this into a ReactJS application and serve it directly from Edge Delivery Services, which will be the next part of this series.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 5
Building a ReactJS app
This is part 5 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create a React App that uses Edge Delivery Services as the data source.
Previously
We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with a block to serve the content.
Part 5 - Building a React app with documents as the source
As a developer, you may be more familiar with ReactJs and want to use those skills in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. You may also have an existing ReactJs app that you want to bring into the Edge Delivery Services Infrastructure. Whatever your reason, this tutorial will help you use ReactJs with Edge Delivery.
I walk you through converting the slide builder block we built in part 4 into a modular React app. We'll cover the key steps and considerations to ensure a smooth transition.
1. Understanding the Original Structure
The original approach was a block consisting of a single JavaScript file (slide-builder.js) and a corresponding CSS file (slide-builder.css). This monolithic approach worked well within the Edge Delivery Services ecosystem, it needs modularity to work well with React.
2. Breaking Down the Components
The first step in our conversion is to identify the main components of our application:
- SlideBuilder: The main container for all slides
- SlideItem: Individual slide components
- SlidePanel: The panel that opens when a slide is clicked
3. Setting Up the React Project
Start by creating a new React project. You can use Create React App or your preferred React boilerplate.
After creating a new React project with the Create React App, you can streamline your project by removing several files that aren't necessary for our conversion. Here's a list of files you can safely delete:
1. In the `src` folder:
- `App.test.js` (We are a tutorial, no tests. Do this later)
- `logo.svg` (the React logo, which we won't be using)
- `reportWebVitals.js` (we will not need web vitals reporting)
- `setupTests.js` (no tests, see above)
2. In the `public` folder:
- `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` (React logos)
- `manifest.json` (We are not building a Progressive Web App)
- we can delete favicon.ico
- `robots.txt`
Rename index.html to slides.html
After cleaning up, your project structure might look like this:
This cleaned-up structure provides a good starting point for implementing your converted React application. You can now add your new components and styles to the `src` folder. The final project structure will end up like this.
The index.html<!DOCTYPE html>
Now app.js
Instead of directly fetching data in the decorate function, I used React's useEffect hook in the App component to fetch slide data when the component mounts.
app.css
We employ hooks such as React, useState, and useEffect in React. Additionally, we integrate the SlideBuilder component and the App.css file. The App function component serves as the foundation of our application. With the assistance of the useState hook, we effectively manage the "slides" state. To retrieve slide data upon component mounting, we utilize the useEffect hook. The fetchSlides function, an asynchronous operation, acquires slide data from the "/slides/query-index.json" endpoint. The component structure encompasses a header and a primary section. Within the main section, the SlideBuilder component is rendered, passing slide data as a property.
index.js, remove core web vitals
Change README.md
4. Creating React Components
Now, let's create our React components:
- src/components/SlideBuilder.js
- src/components/SlideItem.js
- src/components/SlidePanel.js
Don’t worry about dangerouslySetInnerHTML. I only obtained a text node in the first place.
Each component encapsulates its logic and render method.
The core logic from the original `decorate` function was distributed among these components:
- Moved slide fetching logic to the main App component
- Implemented background image loading in SlideItem
- Handled panel opening/closing in SlideItem and SlidePanel
5. Styling
Create separate CSS files for each component:
- src/styles/SlideBuilder.css
- src/styles/SlideItem.css
- src/styles/SlidePanel.css
Build the output
To distribute your React application, you must create a production build and then deploy it. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you need to do:
Create a Production Build:
In your project directory, run the following:
npm run build
This command creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
The build directory will contain:
To distribute your app, you need to serve the contents of the build directory.
Returning to our Edge Delivery Services repository, it looks similar to the archetypal boilerplate.
Copy the internal part of the build folder, the static folder and the index.html to the root of the Edge Delivery Repo
Rename index.html to slides.html
Now, the Repo is integrated, as seen below.
We have added slides.html and the static directory.
Now commit and push your Repo.
Conclusion
Converting an Edge Delivery Services block to a React application involves breaking down the monolithic structure into reusable components, adapting the logic to work with React's lifecycle and hooks, and ensuring that all functionality is preserved. While it requires some effort, the result is an extensible codebase that leverages the power of React's component-based architecture. I prefer the block format; this tutorial is to help give you options.
Remember, this conversion is just the beginning. Once in React, you can further enhance your application with additional features, optimize performance, and integrate with other React libraries and tools. If your customer already has a ReactJS application, a calculator, or something more sophisticated, you can easily integrate this into your Edge Delivery Services site collection.
The final ReactJS application, served directly from GitHub, cannot be previewed using the sidekick and thus cannot be published through it. Despite this, it is live. You can view it here https://allabout.network/slides.html

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 6
Json and GitHub
A bit more info on Json, using GitHub as a fallback for sheets
This is part 6 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services; this time, we will investigate Json and The GitHub connection.
Previously
We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with ReactJS to serve the content.
Part 6 - Json and Github
Edge Delivery Services can create an index of published material; one uses a Google sheet/ Microsoft Excel sheet to do this work. Full details here Indexing (www.aem.live)
If we provide the blank query index in the notes folder, they are entered into the sheet as shown when Edge Delivery Servies creates published pages.
Then the json is produced by the url main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.live/notes/query-index.json
We discussed all of this in an earlier article, in part 3.
The critical thing to note is the structure of the json returned from the sheet; we can create json from a sheet by creating titles and cell entries like this.
This, in turn, will provide simple json
In edge delivery services, any json that is provided in the root folder with the path name of header.json is applied to the website. Edge Delivery Services will use these headers for the paths mentioned in the url element. Note the wildcard. Custom HTTP Response Headers (www.aem.live)
You may not want to give content authors complete control over the headers; it is a complex subject with wildcarding and key/value entries. I suggest making this a developer's responsibility.
If you create a matching headers.json in your code editor and add it to the GitHub root folder, then GitHub will be used if the sheet has yet to be created. The beauty of Edge Delivery services is that if the user is technical and aware of the technique to create their sheet, they can do so, and their version of the json will override the developer-provided one. I use this technique in my development of Edge Delivery Services Projects.
I have configuration information in a file named /config/defaults.json in my GitHub.
I have kept the generated JSON original layout as if I had created it on a sheet. However, I have changed the type to ‘fallback’ so that I can debug it later.
If we need to change things on production without releasing new code, we just have to create a new sheet named defaults with all the information, including the changes and then publish it.
Other sheets used in Edge Delivery Services are
Metadata (Bulk Metadata (www.aem.live))
Redirects (Redirects (www.aem.live))
Config (Project Configuration (www.aem.live)) is a particular item in a special folder. It cannot be served on the web and cannot be previewed.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 7
Useful Components
Blocks I use in my guides.
Index
Returntotop
Bloglist
I explain the additional blocks I use in my guides.
Previously
We discussed Google Sheets/ Excel spreadsheets, Edge Delivery Services automatic conversion to Json, and the ability to create fallbacks in Github.
Part 7 - Useful Components
In building this series, I have created three blocks (or components, in old CMS speak) that help provide navigation widgets.
Index - provides an expanding index of the topics in the article.
Returntotop - provides a back-to-top button when the reader scrolls away from the opening viewport.
Bloglist - provides a list of related articles.
Each block is designed to be intuitive for the user and easy for the content author, automating the work. The content author just has to place the item in the correct place in the document, as a block fragment, queued in by a table. The code achieves this functionality using vanilla JavaScript, CSS 3 and DOM manipulation; no frameworks or libraries are involved - this is the perfect way to create Edge Delivery Services blocks (components).
returntotop
I will begin with the simplest one, returntotop
The function makes the "Back to Top" button visible when the user scrolls down over 100 pixels. The page smoothly scrolls back to the top when the button is clicked.
This block has two cells: the first one is the block name, and the second is the content. The content is the wording the author wants to use when it is displayed; one may wish to use different phrasing or say it in French; it is up to the content author.
As always, create the folder returntotop under the blocks folder, then make two files returntotop.css and returntotop.js
returntotop.css contains the styling.
.
The returntotop.js contains the code.
It adds an event listener to the window object that listens for the scroll event. The button is displayed when the user scrolls down more than 100 pixels (display: 'block'). Otherwise, the button is hidden (display: 'none').
index
Once again, create a folder inside blocks called index and two files, index.css and index.js, in this folder.
Index.css should contain
And index.js
This code creates an interactive webpage index by selecting all header elements (h1 to h6) and the index block. It creates an index header with a clickable arrow and an index content container. The index is built lazily - only when the user first clicks on the index header. Clicking the index header toggles the visibility of the index content and rotates the arrow.
The buildIndex function creates a list of links to all headers on the page, indenting them based on their header level (h1, h2, etc.). Each header is given a unique ID, and the index links are created to point to these IDs.
Finally
bloglist
Create a folder inside blocks called bloglist and then add the two files bloglist.css and bloglist.js.
Bloglist.css
This CSS creates a responsive blog list layout, using CSS Grid for the blog list, with auto-fitting columns. Each blog item is a flex container with a border. Blog images are set to a fixed height with full width. The last modified date is pushed to the bottom with a separator line. On mobile (< 600px), it switches to a single-column layout.
The Javascript file
The Javascript fetches blog data from "/query-index.json", filtering blog items to include only those with "developer-guide" in the path, sorts the filtered items alphabetically by title, generates HTML content for the blog list and inserts the generated content into the DOM.

# Guide to Creating Blocks in Edge Delivery Services (EDS) or Franklin, Helix

Blocks are modular components used in development to create reusable and customizable sections of a webpage.

## Block Structure
- Each block typically consists of two main files, and an optional third:
  1. A CSS file (e.g., `blockname.css`) for styling
  2. A JavaScript file (e.g., `blockname.js`) for functionality
  3. a README.md for documentation


If asked to create a block, one should always create a README.md alongside it

## Key Components of a Block

### CSS File
- Contains styles specific to the block
- Often includes responsive design for different screen sizes
- May use CSS variables for theming

### JavaScript File
- Exports a `decorate` function as the default
- The `decorate` function typically:
  - Manipulates the DOM to create the block's structure
  - Adds event listeners for interactivity
  - Fetches data if needed (e.g., from JSON files)
  - Applies dynamic styling
  
### Markdown File
- Contains documentation of use to the developer, maintainer or content author

### Common Patterns
- Use of `document.createElement` to create elements
- Applying classes for styling
- Creating nested structures (e.g., for carousels or grids)
- Fetching and processing data (often using `fetch` API)
- Implementing responsive behavior

## Best Practices
1. Keep blocks modular and reusable
2. Use semantic HTML where possible
3. Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
4. Optimize for performance (lazy loading, efficient DOM manipulation)
5. Follow a consistent naming convention for classes and IDs

## Advanced Features
- Some blocks may use external libraries or APIs
- Complex blocks may implement lazy loading or infinite scrolling
- Interactive blocks often use event delegation for efficiency

## Integration
- Blocks are typically integrated into a larger project structure
- They may interact with a content management system or data layer
- Often used in conjunction with a main JavaScript file that handles overall page behavior

This guide provides a high-level overview of creating blocks in web development. Each block type has its own specific implementation details and requirements.

What follows is sample blocks from my GitHub repository

        let author = '';

        // Check if the <img> element has a non-empty alt attribute
        if (imgElement && imgElement.getAttribute('alt')) {
            author = imgElement.getAttribute('alt');
        }

        // If the alt attribute is empty or not present, fall back to the <meta> tag's author content
        if (!author) {
            const metaAuthor = document.querySelector('meta[name="author"]');
            if (metaAuthor) {
                author = metaAuthor.getAttribute('content');
            }
        }

        // Create a new <strong> element to hold the author name
        const authorElement = document.createElement('strong');
        authorElement.textContent = author;

        // Find the .bio.block element
        const bioBlock = document.querySelector('.bio.block');

# return to top block

This code adds a "return to top" button feature to the webpage. Here's how it works:

1. **Button Selection:** It first identifies the button element on the webpage that is intended to return the user to the top of the page. This button is marked with a specific class.

2. **Scroll Event Handling:** The code listens for when the user scrolls up or down on the page. If the user scrolls down more than 100 pixels, the button is made visible. If the user scrolls back up so that they are within 100 pixels from the top, the button is hidden.

3. **Button Click Behavior:** When the visible button is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls back to the top. This gives users a quick and easy way to return to the top of the page without having to manually scroll back up.

##### This is the end of the examples

When asked to create anything, if the result is a block, remember to create a README.md

All js, cs and md files should obey the air-bnb linting style guide

use await rather than .then() for asynch code

always list every line and function in code

lib-franklin.js has been renamed aem.js; remember to check this in the generated code and replace it if necessary
